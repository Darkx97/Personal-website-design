                    <h1>Being my self</h1>
                    <p>
                        I always tried to act like the "cool" kids or people around me when I was young ... well , younger.

                        As a kid I was really shy and for me , it was very difficult to act "normal" , and inside my little head I was always thinking "what should I do or say" when im around people and other kids.

                        And most the time I thought "oh I can say what this other kids or adult said " , and it was this idea of acting like that other "cooler" person around , and it always coming out awkward cuz that wasn't me and other people and kids notice that , even if they don't know it , and it ends up with them trying to go away from that weird kid , or they try to bully and isolate that kid and making fun of it , both had happened, ended up with me being hard to talk to or play with because of my weak social skills

                        Of course I had some friends , I was able to talk to them , but most my time was with just me and my thoughts witch ended up with me still talking to my self loud enough for people to hear me but not loud enough to know what im saying , thing that I still do to this day.

                        but that idea of copying other people's behavior kept going for the rest of my school life , ended up with me being a mix of every one around me , and that changed me to the worst after being repeatedly physically and mentally damaged from most the kids around me in school , I was a toxic person to hang with even for my friends , I didn't know who am I , didn't I want to do , what I want to say , how I want to say it , what do I feel

                        So my friends decided they wont talk to me anymore , and that was the only people I was able to be my self around without thinking in my brain , "what should I say , what should I do , do I look weird if I did or say something " , I lost all of this , and I deserved it , so I "thought to my self maybe if I go back to my old self , I'll be able to talk to my friends again , but what is my old self ", I realise that even my old self was mostly a mix of what ever people around me I was for the most part not my self , and that was me realising I'm was not my self at all

                        But having my friends again was worth it for me , so I tried to build my self as a person by doing what I think is right to do , fell what I think is right , saying what I think is Right to say , and the answer was always based on "values" that I already set for every thing around witch lead me to re-think these "values" as to "why do I think this is right , what makes "this" better than "that" , how do I decide if any of those acts,feelings,words is the best to say , and are they only better for me or are they better for everyone , am I only looking for my own good or , should I take others in consideration and why " , and that happened a lot and I tried to do , say or feel what I thought is the best that I can do based on that thought.

                        But it wasn't a fast progress most the times , it had me thinking of situations long after they have happened , and even when my friends decided to forgive me I was barely able to describe how happy I was that they are welling to talk to me again , sometimes they look at my face and ask , "why do you look sad ", I just reply "I m not sad , I think I just don't know how to describe my self"

                        But I kept on trying to learn who I am and acted according to what I thought I was , and throughout my journey of learning , I was able to see who people relay are , I new different people , and some of them just open them self when its just me and them in a room , they tell me things that I would think they would never tell others in the society we live in , perhaps they are afraid of being judged so they put an act and they call it "normal". when I was acting my self all that time in front of them , some even called me "strange person" , when I ask why , they usually say you're just different from other people that around this place , you really act like you don't care" , and I just say "im just being my self , thats who I am", this is mostly followed by silence.

                        These situations remind of a quote from a game I used to play it says "master your self , master the enemy" , and most ppl that open to I don't really conceder all of them being my friends , sometimes they might just hate me , but I know one thing , they do respect me.

                        So when I decided to enter the virtual world to talk to people , I found out that even in the most anonymous environment people are still hiding them selves acting to what they call "normal" , maybe even afraid of being judged from people around them , but I was lucky enough to find some actual people that I was able to talk to , and sometimes I say things about my self like "im a little weird" or "im just boring", and people say " no your not boring" or , " I don't think your weird , your just different " , and usually say "i don't know im just being my self" , one of my friends in there even said " I think you're a cool person , because I feel when I talk to you im talking to the "real" you" , and that reminded me with a story that I saw in a kids cartoon when I was younger :

                        "The main character of the show is a smart kid , he was embarrassed that his father was not a "cool"man.

                        So he decides to make a machine to turn his father into a "cool" man , at first he enjoyed it , util he find out that his father was so different from who he really , and turned to be a whole different person.

                        He decides to turn him back , and when his father is back to his actual self , he still remembered everything happened and he new that his son have done that to him , maybe out of embracement of who he was , but his father doesn't punish him , he told "you know son , its not easy to be "cool" but its not "cool" bot be other than yourself" ".

                        For me it was until my friend told me that about my self that I realized the real meaning to that episode of that show , its interesting how the answer have been hovering in front of me all the time , yet I was un able to find it my self .

                        Of course im not saying that I am a "cool" person , but im saying that people keep trying to act "cool" all the time , maybe to look good or maybe to impress others , or maybe they are embarrassed from the society , but they forget the most "cool" thing that they can do , just being who they really are.

                        Thanks my friend , would probably never found the answer my self .

                        And thank you for reading.
