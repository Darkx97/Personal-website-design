                <h1>Sufian</h1>
                <h3>welcome to my website</h2>
                <p>my name is Sufian.
                    im a computer science student learning software development. 
                    i made this website to be my place on the internet , its going to contain everything about me , my projects , plans , thoughts and im gonna have a diary on this website , basically its my virtual room in here .

                    when i started making this website i was already 2 years into the major, i used to know almost nothing about software development and i started making website as a practice to learn on my own, a year later (now). i learned a lot about software and web development and decided that im gong to use this website as my personal website and probably expand on it to be a simple , less addictive social media. than the rest of the known platforms.
                    i still have other projects you can click on projects in the navigation bar , or of your on mobile click the burger icon to open the navigation menu.

                    some of the projects i have even started yet , im cuz im still learning how to actually do them.
                    the website is going to be up to date with what im actually working , and if i canceled it or not.

                    for now the main focus is this website as i want to work with website development, its going to be sort of a free open source project any one should be able to take this project and make it work as thier own personal website with few commands.
                    
                    im still in the 3rd year ,at the time i wrote this (early 2021).
                    the covid-19 pandemic did slow me down for a year , i wasn't able to attend to university.
