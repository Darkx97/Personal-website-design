                    <h4>Lost</h4>
                    <p>
im pretty sure im experiencing some breakdown  issue , at least based on my last diary . 

im really not sure what to do , im sort of thinking about giving in to the depression , i don't seem to be able to get my self out of it anyway , things are not going well and i don't see my self fixing stuff any time soon , or even getting better i cant really work anymore , my project faidl and i need to start again . 

i asked for help and the only answer i got is , that i need to look for resources that can help me with my problem , cuz i might need professional help .

im pretty sure i need to get at least some help , but i sort of know that we don't have that kind of help here,  the only help available is expensive as hell  and i know i cant afford it . 

im so focused on my negatives that i don't see any positive about my self at all . 

im starting to have some weird thing , im not sure what its called , but during the day , i just start to cry out of no ware , i never actually cried cuz i sort of keep things under control . and i calm my self down . 

this never happened before , even tho i think i got things a bit under control , i still get that  some days i get that multiple times . 

i don't even know how to fix it , its just me and my diary for now .

this could end in a good way or really bad way only time well tell .

                    <h4>Sad truth or Stupid thoughts</h4>
                    <p>
the plan today was to actually practice and study some calculus , but ofc i didn't , i also haven't done my prayers in about 2 weeks , im wasting all the time i have im working on nothing .

i cant get my self to start doing any of those , im too tired to wake up , i have to attend lectures and even by the time all this is done im still tired as hell , im not sure whats the problem . . . well its actually my sleep schedule , i cant fix it at all . 

so now im just sitting here thinking about all the time i wasted , i noticed that i spent all of it around a people that i liked to talk to , they even told me that they do like talking to me , but im soo fukin skeptical i don't know how to relax for some reason , they say actions speak louder than words , and their actions were for the most part saying what their  words are saying .

but for the past few days i've noticed that a lot of people are taking the piss at me , don't get me wrong i do the same , but im not 5+ people , see when a lot of people tell me that im just an asshole , they are probably right , when they tell me im racist they are probably right .

when they treat me as "a punching back/a joke" , they are probably right , im not sure what i did to make people  go against me constantly , but im pretty sure its cuz im weak as person , probably on every scale , i can do "D" at best .

im not smart , im not good at talking or talking back to people , im not strong physically or mentally  , i don't have much knowledge , other than computers i cant really do anything , i don't have a "skill" , i don't even have a good argument on anything , i lack experience almost in everything , i don't seem to add anything to any group im in , i cant really keep communications between me and people , fuk im not even a good cook for someone who really likes food , im ugly as hell , i don't even have a fukin job i cant pull my weight  , and i im failing in my university .

i've always thought that i have some sort of a skill , at least when it came to talking to people i thought that the only skill i had was me being the casual joker , i sort of try to make people laugh at things that could be unconformable to talk about if said the wrong way . 

but seems like , im not a the joker im just A joke . 
its not that i don't want to be made fun of , but with the right amount of people and the right frequency , it dose make me change my mind on things eventually . 

i know i shouldn't care that much about how people interaction with me , but i guess its cuz im in my 20's and still at that age , still gonna care about my reputation . 

im trying to shift my focus from it , i don't know if i'll be able to do that , im pretty much a failure in everything . 

to add insult to injury , none of the old communities that i used to be part ever really tried to "reach" to me , which is another conformation to how much of joke i am . 

hopefully i'll get to study something tomorrow or work on something .
im not sure i have any well power left , but i'll try , nothing else to do .

- that night i felt very un-safe in my house i felt the NEED to lock my room and have the light on

                    <h4>A bit confused</h4>
                    <p>
i've fallen of my schedule , haven't been doing my routine , or , my religious duties .

didn't work on my project , studies for you hours , very in efficient for the past 9-8 days , 
did some stuff im not very proud of , im trying to battle my masturbation addiction , i blocked my computer form accessing any porn website , i think i should make it harder to change  that setting  , im not sure how , but i'll find a way .

im planing to start working out tomorrow , hopefully that goes well , i need to  go back to my schedule , i need to fix my sleep schedule , and practice more calculus , im getting there but there is more stuff to study . 

i did update the website look just a lil bit .

i've been thinking of making my own podcast maybe dev-log for the project , re doing the tutorial .

not really care about falling , a lot of my friends say that im too hard on my self i need to forgive my self for failing and focus on what i learned. 

re-write and re-design my CV , and apply for as many jobs as I can find .

topics to start with , introduction , what i do ,  future plans , challenges . 

imposter syndrome , depression , society image , persona . overthinking.

start reading again ffs .

                    <h4>Learning things</h4>
                    <p>
so for t he past few days i've been trying to learn calculus1 with not much of luck , seems like i didn't understand much , but i'll have to keep doing it anyway since i don't have much time to learn , as finals are getting closer and closer everyday . 


been communicating with few people , and been thinking of stuff i could i add to my website , a search bar could be useful , tags feature the ability to make gorps and making projects work like blogs in away that users well be able to add more content later , and talk about updates , and show the progress , basically every project is going to have its page 


yesterday tho i didn't study at all and i might not study today as well i know im running out of time , i cant start working or studying at all for some reason kinda like my brain is locked . . . again

i'll try after i eat today and see if i can work or not 

so this is at the end of this day , i did something im not very proud of (masturbating) , and im not sure how im gonna fight that cuz now it feels like an addiction , im not sure , but that could be me seeking short term pleasure , maybe cuz im ignoring something . 

thing is i usually view pornography , and the plan for now i to not do that ever again . 

i'll try taking few deep breaths every time i get close to do that again 

that usually works for most the time .

i don't know who might be reading this , but trust me it is fucking embarrassing to say that for me.  

but i also find it funny so don't feel bad for laughing at it XD

someday people well be able to comment on that. 

and i can only images me getting roasted XD , i'll actually stop reporting this everyday and i'll probably do it once a month or once a week , so that it doesn't turn this diary as whole about me getting over this thing alone , cuz i have other things to get right .

till next time .

                    <p>
so it was suppose to be just another boring day , i just didn't get to sleep that was probably the only difference that was suppose to be there .

actually my friend that offered to help me with , my sort of mental esh problems , they told me that they loved the projects page of my website , his feedback was mostly positive , which made me think maybe my project isn't that bad after all , or it has a potential  to be good , and that , i can probably make something of value , maybe i was selling my self short .

did some work on my website , attended my quiz and tried to stayed awake as i only got 2-3 hours of sleep .

all up until i watched a video that quickly discusses the villain on an animated movie called "kong fu panda" 

and yes i know it dose sound silly might as well be silly as hell , the main villain was a "person" who was raised by his teacher who also played a rule as his father too who told him " you are distanced to greatness " , the  villain work his hardest his whole life to prove that he is great , and that he  would be worth of the greatest kong fu fighter , he would reach that by obtaining the knowledge of a scroll , called the dragon scroll , his (teacher/father) believed in him , he taught  him all he know , cared for him , loved him as his real son , and when the time came for his test , the dojo master told him that , the he (the villain) have some darkness in him .

his father was proud of him , yet he never really said that to him , he failed like he was un-appreciated , at some point his failure makes drives him mad , and he attacks his father demanding him to say that hes proud of him , what lead him to this point was the lack of criticism from his father , he always pushed forward to achieve greatness , meaning the scroll , which be came a physical representation of his father's pride  in him . he felt like he has to have that  scroll , as it was his only  way to see  his father being proud of him. 

he was stopped once by the master , and imprisoned , but he escaped , and the master was no more , the only one who could stop him from destroying the dojo , would be the dragon worrier ( the hero ) , before he fights the hero , he goes back to the dojo to fight his father , as they are fighting he demands that his father says that hes is proud of him and  his father dose , he pauses for a second as if he came back to his sense ,  but it was already too late .

he finds out that the scroll is no longer there , and that's when the hero show's up 

thats where i'll stop there

ngl at that point i was already crying . 

well its something that i sort of deal with , but from a different "angle" . 
for me i always wanted to hear those words from my father "proud of you" or even my mother , but so far its like i didn't even come close to that , my experience was that i never really been a good enough but , but  i was always told that i had potential , to be something much better than my self , i was already trying hard to get any of my parents to say they are proud of me , but never happened , they never really acted like there were too , i tried to do my best at school , which i gave it all i can really , up until the 7th grade , they never said anything to acknowledge that " you did your best and thats good enough " , it was always " you could have done better " or even " you should do better " , and yes i probably should have done better , but i was already doing my best . 

i still kept on trying to make them proud of me , but every time i look at them , i can see  the disappointment in their eyes , the way they talk at me . 
i was always reminded that im not good enough , by being compared to other kids from the family. and was told , compared to my older sisters , who never got punished for doing something bad , which made them arrogant , even they don't really realise it they are . 

my father , never really spent any time with me really , outside of " want you to work this thing with me " , we never really talked i don't think we know each other , he never really teach me anything that he knows about anything , made me feel like i wasn't worth the investment , and that made me feel like un-worthy , and i still to this day feel like that.

was always told i'll never be as good as them , and was always being punished for any mistake , always seemed like it was never acknowledged that i made some sort of improvement , and was still being told that i could do better and im lazy , thats why im not doing good. even tho i was doing my best . 

no wonder why i got burnt out and had a breakdown , multiple times , i  just basically learned that it really doesn't matter how good i think i am , cuz im not even close to good enough , and it doesn't matter if did my best cuz that wasn't enough work and im being lazy .

keep pushing my self to the point of breaking

i still don't think my parents are bad people , maybe they just couldn't care about me , im the middle child , so thats probably why , but im the eldest son.

                    <h4>Confusion</h4>
                    <p>
again for the past few days i really didn't nothing probably checked my website to see what i can add or remove from it as features , im still thinking about about the chat feature .

and the tag feature , i also know that i want to make a group feature . 

but thats for the future me . 

but anyway. 


today i went to the VR-Chat party event that some of my friends do every week on saturday . 

i actually met the person that offered to talk about my problems there , it went very well the start , but at some point , it felt like . . . people are ignoring me , which i'm sort of used to , but not for a group of friends , or a group that i feel like a belong to . 

which made the "bitch" side of me start working anxiety , am i being ignored , i tried to say hi to someone and they didn't respond it happened multiple times , i though that my game was buggy - which happens a lot - so i did everything that i know to counter the bug , went there to say hi , and its like they didn't hear me .

other people join and they get a welcome , that made me feel , un-wanted , i've texted one of them a lot recently and my text was too wordy , so i thought , it was just that , tried to talk to others . . . and sort of same thing , so i sort of am setting down in the corner think about about it (yes thats how anxious i can get sometimes , its bad  , i do my best to fight it ) .

which made me feel un-wanted on multiple levels , and that sort of . . . made me think how many other people , don't want to talk to me , started to make me think about how much easier it was when i really had no one , and it was much easier cuz i didn't want to make friends and connections , and i started thinking -again- that maybe i should , be a totally antisocial person . 

sort if cut everyone , and only care about my self , but while being in the boundaries of a good person.

and im thinking , maybe i should , and the first thing to do , is to stop sharding whats on my mind with anyone , maybe only my irl friends , cuz all that happened with my online friends . 

i could be overthinking this too much cuz there was a lot of people around anyway and communicating was a bit hard , im just very anxious sometimes

some of them know about this website meaning they can see this diary now , hope they don't think i hate them , cuz i don't , i don't hate anyone , and hope they don't get the wrong idea about what i think about them . 

im not gonna blame that on anxiety or depression , it's just thoughts i have from time to time. 

to give them credit , they came later and talked to me , i decided not to talk about my anxiety at that point , and act like everything is fine , i still appreciate them caring . 

i the person i was talking to recently what they thought of my website and other than the coloring , they said it was really well done , and im probably selling my self short . was really great to hear and im greatly for that , i hope it is true , im still very anxious about my skills , even tho they improved a lot .

i'll act like everything is ok out of no where , and i know people can see through that , im still gonna refuse to actually talk ,i'll do my best to do that this way . 

this definitely means  alto of breakdowns , but its ok i'll be fine . i'll be able to handle them.

and slowly stop being active , like maybe not be there tomorrow , but the day after join , then leave for more time .

slowly taking my self out of everyone ones life .

on  the bright side , i had one of my friends telling me that they do care about me , and that they used to leave chatting with other people , to chat with me , and they enjoyed spindling time with me . 

that made me feel , like i made something of value i was really really happy to hear that , and i'm probably going to just throw it away , makes me want to cry .
but , im starting to think , no coast is too hight , for piece of mind . 
its ok , im probably really really easy to replace anyway . 

im not sure if its something i've done , i really hope its something wrong with me , cuz that is much easier thing to deal with that , the "whole world" is wrong .

im still really grateful for every time anyone actually cared about my well being , it would be so wrong to just throw that out of the window .

i might not do that , but thats the second time i consider this , this year .

                    <h4>Panic</h4>
                    <p>
haven't studied anything , i actually worked a little on the website for the past few days . 

things gone find expert for the missed up sleep schedule . 

so what the panic is for .

today and 2 days ago , i masturbated ... kinda more than i usually do , some people might not see it as a big issue but it is for me , i was disgusting , hate my self for doing this and i felt like worthless piece of shit . 

im not sure why do i get sort of the urge to do  it , even tho i hate the results , maybe i feel good for like few minutes but its not worth doing it . its sort of like an addiction at this point . 

i also did watch a lot of pornography , which i should have not done too , and i think thats why im failing the whole thing , so i need to make sure i don't watch that "content" ever again . that would be one of the first steps to sort of fix my life ... 


the first step i've been taking is , i was doing almost all my  prayers every day (im a muslim and we have to do that 5 times a day) , im starting to have it as a habit now so thats good too  . i can sort of maintain it . 
i also was staying away from my working on the website of as much as i can , but not totally . 


im not sure exactly what to do next , but i know i need to study for my finals . 
i might start workout like probably an hour a day , and have a walk  an hour the other day , that might post my  confidence , and probably would help me to stay away from ym masturbation problem. . . 

i cant believe that im actually sharing this online , but , at the same time there is a part of me that really dosent give a shit what people gonna think of me .

again its sort mostly an uneventful day in terms of progress. 

i was getting more and more anxious throughout the day, but i tried to ignore it. 

i thanked my friend for helping me with their advice, i said that i hope i wasn't troubling them with my questions... they said it wasn't troubling sense they were the one offering help. 


they also said they would be open to talk about other things and they are happy to communicate, and ngl, i would really enjoy talking in general. 

ill try  to work through my anxiety and talk to them more, i do like them, my problem is im kinda getting worst as conversions 

their advice was to focus on my studies, and ill have time for the project latter. 

no need to rush. 

im looking forward to talk to them again.

so now that i have at least some idea about what my "problem" might be. 

its time to figure out some solution .

> first thing should probably be a schedule ; having a routine can be boring sometime , but the schedule doesn't have to be a torture to go though , having a schedule is important for staying motivated and not doing too much work , and paying attention for when i do too little work . 

it also needs to be somewhat flexible .


> Removing a lot of my focus on the (amount) of progress , and focusing on doing the progress , without over working my self . 

> stop comparing my work to other work ; this well make working on my projects or even just working very hard , as i well feel like i didn't nothing in so much time , or i'll look at my work as irrelevant . 

> Knowing when to stop to work on my project : this project has been takin all the time for the past year , and i still can work on it a bit more , but i should stop at some point , i cant work on it for ever . 

> I need to stop being soo critical about the flaws in my work , nothing is perfect , and punishing my self for every small mistake is counter productive .

>i might be doing better than i think . 

im still dealing with some depression tho , and im not sure where to go from here , im not sure if anyone would discuss this with me . 

im still feeling worthless most the time . 

i haven no clue how to solve these problems , usually i just sleep and hope for the best , but now i have sleep problems . 

hope things turn to a bit better situation.

my sleep schedule completely ruined too.


i failed the whole "not jacking off" thing few times . im still trying to put more days in between . 

but i might just stop reporting that . i don't know yet , i don't really care about people reading this cuz its mostly for me , i just right my problems and thoughts here just re make sure that im aware of them , and maybe solve them . 

but ... enjoy laughing at it XD. kinda funny

                    <h4>A need for change</h4>
                    <p>
im not sure how many day it has been. 

probably 5 

i haven't done any work or studying at all, and my finals are getting close. 
i sent a message to that person who offered to listen and help me with some advice. 

it was worth the investment, they were nice, and they gave me good answers, and they where really supportive. 

probably a possible friend. 

they told me that im working long hours on my project, and that im getting a burnout cuz of it, they told me that i most likely doing better that i think im doing, and  that no need to rush my learning. 

they suspected that i might have a condition called imposter syndrome 

they told me to focus on my study for now and not work my self totally out. 

and that i would be more than fine with just the skills i currently have 

during that time few things  happened. 
i sort of got another break down. 

i talked to a friend of mine about how i would love to make that a better relationship with my family , but it doesn't sent seem like they are welling. 

i explained my thoughts on why most my friends are usually older than me, and  how i think the whole father figure thing. 

they ware older than me, they told me that they understand why i would seek a father figure. 

but at some point none of my father or father figure would be able to give me an advice to a situation. 

so i shouldn't focus on it too much.
and maybe i should try to make a move and fix my relationship with my father. 

at least i should try. 


i thanked both these people for helping and listening. 

i hope that i can return the favor someday

i  also experienced something that happened to me for the first time. 

sleep paralysis, before i totally sleep. 

those usually happen after i wake up, this time it felt violent, i was hearing a loud sound, kinda like a loud banding on a wooden table, or something like the weird sound that keeps on replaying it self whe a computer crashes.
also felt pain im my head. 
it was terrifying. i couldn't move i couldn't talk or yell. 
i was scared to sleep after it was done. 

my sleep schedule completely ruined too.


i failed the whole "not jacking off" thing few times . im still trying to put more days in between . 

but i might just stop reporting that . i don't know yet , i don't really care about people reading this cuz its mostly for me , i just right my problems and thoughts here just re make sure that im aware of them , and maybe solve them . 

but ... enjoy laughing at it XD. kinda funny

                    <h4>Depression ?</h4>
                    <p>
so i tried to do something today, i made icons for the website , but they where not good , so i canceled on them for now .

i designed the login and register pages . i didn't do any learning today at all , or practice on my math  stuff . 

its been sort of a slow day , anxiety was always there , one of my friends said that i sound either soo tired , or depressed . 

im hoping that im just tired , i don't think getting depressed now is manageable for me , i still  have things i want to do . 

but not to lie about it , i sort of didn't want to do things today rather than being tried or lazy .

i might try to talk to the person who offered to talk about it today , but im not sure how to start it , but i'll try one msg kind of explaining wut might i be like to talk to . 

i don't know if im not good enough , or if im self distractive . or if there is something im not aware of . 

but i'll see what i can do , i might try to do some math practice but thats highly unlikely .

i almost started crying about 2-3 times today , im being so emotional and i don't like it .

i just don't know what to do , and i feel like i need something like a father figure in my life .

even tho i still live with my parents , i don't think i can really talk to my father at all about what problem i might be facing . 

im sure hes not aware of what problem i might be having. and i kind of don't think he cares about anything other than me finding a job and taking care of my self . 

so close , yet out of reach , i cant bring my self to talk to him really , throughout my life , i've seen the look on my father's face when he's looking at me , that look 90% of the time was always meant 
" your not good enough / you should be better / your just wasting time / you don't know what's best for you / your still naive / others are better than you / your probably the worst / you never improve ".

i don't know where to go with that , it didn't seem like he wanted to talk to me for real , i never got to know him , he never really tried . and i feel like im just there somehow . he doesn't know what to do about it anymore , i don't know what to do about it anymore . 

i think thats probably why i tend to make friends with people that are older than me , at least sometimes they feel like someone i can talk to when i have a problem that im not sure how to deal with . or something to at least complain about in a form a conversation from a human to another.

and that person is also older than me , they said they would help , but i don't know how to spot the problem . 

and i don't want to rely on people , cuz usually i end up being disappointed , im easily forgivable . 
im sort of "everyone's friend" but i don't really belong to any sort of group , cuz im the group clown . 
its the role that i chose to take , cuz that the type of person i am , the joker or the jester .

the jester in the kings court is usually perceived as a crazy person , but he's really not . 
he just gets the giggles , when they see people taking things  too seriously , i believe some may probably laughed at their king , and those probably were killed or ignored . 
sense they are crazy .

didn't work on my website at all 

i tried to practice math and did bad but it is expected its my first time in years. 

i still have some more rime to practice but not a lot 


i don't know if ill be able to do the first beta of my website this week 
there is so much to learn in so little time. 

the same person from the past week offered to talk about thongs that bothers me . 

i explained that i do talk to all, but in some cases im not sure how to start talking about it. 

cuz im really direct with what im trying to get from a conversation 

they said the wont mind. 

i might  do that, but. i should sort of warn them to what i am. 

my anxiety levels are increasing 

im sleeping really late, and its not helping too. 

im not sure if ill have enough energy to work or learn anything tomorrow 

but i'll try

                    <h4>A break from work</h4>
                    <p>
so yeah , nothing really happened those 2 days , didn't do anything at all  decided its time for me to take a break from working too much on the project 

i might go back to the design code and make sure its well written , and east to read from a developer stand . 


i talked to my online friends a bit , about things that do bother me and some of them said they wont mind to listen . 

im not sure if i should talk about things that annoy me , but i know it helps with dealing with my anxiety and helps me understand my current situation  and maybe find a solution , so i might do it .

                    <h4>On the right track</h4>
                    <p>
for the last few days , i've been working on the design its done for now , few minor things are left , but other than a log in and a register page , there is nothing left . theme works fine , mobile view is also fine . 

and work seem to be going well , im doing good progress , but it almost feels like its still irrelevant , im .. not sure how to put it in words , but again , it doesn't matter how well i do , i'll still feel like its nothing .

i keep on , sort of ignoring the fact that i did progress , and thinking that i could've done more , or i didn't do enough work . 

and it seems like im losing track of time . 

one of my friends texted me , and i said its been a while , but then he told be its only been 5 days , and i actually checked , and he was right , for the whole time i though it's been 2 weeks , and i only worked 5 days of those 2 weeks , but . . .  there wasn't really 2 weeks missing , im just losing track of time .


and i told that to someone , and they told me that i might be harsh on my self the way i look at this . 

there is always the same ideas . 

i don't have job , i cant really do much work , i'm fat , im not looking for a job anymore , i've never been good at something , even now  i don't feel like im good at anything , some times i feel like even my friends don't like me.   im easy to forget . most likely easily replaceable .

it all hovers around being ... useless , not good enough , a failure . 

and even tho i got 1 week of my anxiety levels going down , i still have anxiety , its coming back and , its not much different than before .

when i talk to an oline friend , i told them this : 
conv start here 
Me : 
yeah now i just uploaded the last thing XD so im gonna stop for now i have to stop
been working on it for past 5 days
i thought the 5 days where 2 weeks XD
and was gettin anxious thinking i was wasting time . 
i need to have some fun playin i guess for now

Me: 
also glad you liked it :D

them  : 
Why would you have been wasting time?

Me : 
hmmmm , the way i look at it is , i think that im useless all the time , kinda has to do with me not being able to find a job an such .
when im working , i dont feel like im useless so i spend as much time as possible , once i stop the " me useless " thing come back .
but i also keep on "puniching" my self for not improving fast or faster

them : 
I feel like you are being too hard on yourself

Me : 
maybe . . . i dont know
i feel like i should be something more , than what i am now

them : 
What I would do is try to allocate time ranges to work in. Like for example, saying you will allow yourself to work until 21:00, and after that you forbid yourself to work, and just enjoy the free time you have without feeling guilty for not working


Me : 
hmm , i try to do that but i end up just using my whole time to upgrade my project and such .
and doing research . 
when i feel like i've done enough , i find no enough time for me to do something else
and i feel like " oh no im too slow at this "
i think i have a lot of things that im a bit insecure about , but its not things people mock me about , its things i mock my self about
its sort of self destructive i think

conv ends here . 

and i think that all the time , that it dosent matter at all , im still useless , no matter what i try , no matter how hard it try something , no matter how much i improve . 

and now im thinking again about , maybe im just . that . 
thing is , i sort of want to be good at something , i want to be good at what i do . 

maybe thats too much to desire  , or the desire it self is too strong , that it stops me from ,  truly living my present . 

i try always to do as much work as possible but i end up with what it feels or looks like nothing been achieved . 
and when i think that its time for me to stop working and maybe try to do something else , it's like not much time left in the day , do anything that i find fun , other than my work . 

i do enjoy it , but , i always feel irrelevant . it  kills my fire sometimes . 

the feeling of being useless is sometimes overwhelming. 
the strongest idea is that i don't have a job , and that is sort of a prove that im useless .

                    <p>
so not much happened past 2 days 

i was still kind of feeling a bite more anxious about not having a job , and not looking for one , and failing that one subject that i felt like i should have not failed , and im more and more drawn to go do work on my project , sense it helps me feel better about my self , sort of remove the feeling of being useless . 

and i think the problem is that i feel useless to begin with , but to me , things do suggest that i am , i cant finish a project been working on for too much longer that i should have , i cant find a job , and im failing subjects in my course , so for my brain the thing i think about is , i must be a looser , useless that is of no good for anything . 

and for whatever reason i do believe in this idea .

however working on my projects makes me feel like , im not soo useless , i might be good at something , maybe im not soo bad after all  .

till i stop doing the work on the project , then the idea of me being useless  start's come back slowly , i noticed that when i was in  VR-Chat , a game where you spend time talking to people in a virtual reality environment , i was spending time with my online friends there , it was a party , and even tho im not party person i live spending time with my friends . 

and even tho i do love that , i started feeling upset about my self , thinking again , im wasting time , i should be working , im so useless . and so on .
i said goodbye to everything and went back trying to work , didn't do very much really but i did something . 

one person seem to notice that im upset , and they offered to listen to me , but i told them that  , there is nothing to worry about , im not sure if i should really talk to them , cuz i might end up talking for too long , or just talking too much . and i didn't want to bother anyone that day 

one of my friends told me that they almost ended their life few days ago , and . .  it was interesting , they keep holding on whatever annoyed them , and they don't talk about it at all , thinking that they damage other people by doing that  , but it only really damages them they do that , they only damage them selfs , but they decided to talk to me and tell me about it , i tried to tell them , if they trust me , im welling to listen , and they wont have to worry about it , cuz my job as a friend is to be there for my friends when they need me . 

they said , we'll see about that , and that they would think about it , i can only hope they do trust me enough , maybe i could help them . 

im starting to also feel like i cant ever try to share that with anyone really , i try to do it anyway , it seems like im asking for help by doing that , but im not sure if i can find it .

there is something about me that , i focus so much on the negative , and dearly acknowledge the positive , like i told one of my friends , that i could never believe a compliment , but i immediately believe any criticism , or negative things said to me . 

with all that aside , i've been contending on making the icons for the website , there is few left in my mind to do and it'll be done . 

the design of the website is 95% done , i need to figure out how i want the about page is going to look like in the end . im not sure of that yet .
but thats going to be done tomorrow . . . which is the day i writing this at , im writing this for yesterday cuz i forgot to do that . 

my sleep schedule is not at its best . but thats gonna be done soon , then i going to move to the backend , and hopefully well be done soon .
and im kind of exited to test that . 

i'd make a version of that project that is for the personal website . one where user should be able to download it and run 2 commands and that would host a website on the machine ,it should run a data base and a web app .  it wont need too much data , so like even slow server can handle whatever , it would have only one user , without the ability to create new users , but one user with user name : admin and password : admin  , and the ability to change that username , and the password .

                    <h4>new design , new strategy</h4>
                    <p>
i spend most of today just working on my design and talking to my online friends 
now im using another way of making things , now im using icons that scale very well with the size of the device .
i changed the user interface a bit . 
im close to finish al of it , before i go back to the back end , now that i know hwo to make people log in and log out . 
i only need to figure out how to upload pictures and videos .
and that would be it for the project . 

all i'll have to do next is hosting it somewhere . 
allow only one user to log in , means removing the register function and have a pre made user for that version of the website , 
make it look a bit different for authenticated users and just un authenticated users.
thats it for the working for now  its kinda of  (5am)  at the time of me making this diary about the day before . 

i have anew plan for the videos and its to finish the whole thing again , and then do continue the videos , both in the back end and the front end . 
i want to make sure that both of them are working like i want . so hopefully that goes well , again i might be able to finish it by the end of the next week.


im getting anxiety back again . 

im feeling overwhelmed , with all the things i need to learn and thinking that i might not be able to make it far .
its like there is soo much that needs to be done so much to keep up with , and its also like i have no chance . 
also feels like my project is just irrelevant , what ever i do about it is . and its like i'll never really finish it . 

im not sure how to deal with that but its annoys me , and  i want to be done with my project . 
i want to see some progress . and sometimes it doesn't feel like i did any .
even tho i clearly did do some at least some progress .

i'll try to fight those thoughts with actually working on the project and improving . 

well see what happens with that . 

but that is it for today .

                    <h4>FAILURE , and new plan</h4>
                    <p>
    
so today i woke up , and had both my exams , i failed the calculus .

decided that im not failing subjects so decide to make a plan .

i m going to be practicing mathematics during the next few months . 

i'll try to make sure im not gonna actually fail any subjects .

im done wi th most exams for now so i can focus on the project .

its gonna be done soon eh hopefully . 

the plan is to make a tag system . 

make a text editor and text tags for links . should probably at some property for code in the tags .

italic and bold and underlined and stile .

all that needs to be added on top of the textarea element . 

and people should be able to highlight text and click on it and it would give them the the tag . . 
i'll try to also add a short cut to it and make sure it only types it on where the pointer is . 

thats ideas for the future so i'll see if i can do them , now i have to figure out how to upload images and videos .

i'll be going back to working on tomorrow . hopefully things go well .

that was is for today

hello im back again with this diary thing . . . . no promises  , but i'll try to make it consistent again . 

how ever there was a bunch of stuff that happened .

i was extremely anxious and almost depressed , really un motivated to do my work but still tried to do it anyway . 

and was also anxious about the future , if im doing progress. and that i would ended with no friends anymore . 

how ever this changed , by the time wrote this . i haven't felt any anxiety in about 5 days .

this happened after i met my irl friends 
i texted them , told them that i was  afraid that they don't see me as friend cuz we don't talk that much anymore , and explained my anxiety . 

and their response was really positive . 

it sort of made my days after better . i don't think i had any anxiety at all during those days . 
i got a bit more energetic , and i was more motivated to do work , which helped me not be anxious about the future . 

im close to finishing my website , i made connected a database to it and the users able to actually log into the website .

i that is left is to do the functions to upload posts , and pictures with them , then probably im going to do a tag system .

and i have to think of some way to make usernames able to be repeated , without having to use email to make that user . 

how ever im going to make it so the email. is a bit more consistent .

my online friends also helped me a lot too , i thanked them for their kindness . 

i met some people from the same profession so that is some thing that i also enjoyed , it did give me more motivation to have someone to talk to about something i enjoy doing . 

and it did motivate me to work a bit more even during the time i was anxious . 

and after that i found a person who was had a lot of pent up stress , they wanted to talk about it , and i thought to my self , this person is exactly in the same spot i was in the past few days ago , and i told them , they can talk and i'll be welling to listen , some other people also joined us .

we all listen to that person , we did have somewhat of similar experience , they where having some problems where they put their efforts in people to help them , but they never seem to get that effort from people when they need it . 

they were emotional about having people around actually listening , which is understandable at least from my end , they seem to never experienced people caring about their well being . 

and i though i could try to help that person , thought it would be ill thing to leave someone in the same situation i was in thinking that its their fault , and probably helping people is a way to sort of give up to people . 

they seem like a nice person and i would love to talk to them again . 

i also did an online test about personality .
turns out i have the architect (engineer) type of personality it was interesting to go through it , i tried my best to give the most honest answers , hopefully i got them right .

that was most of what happened most of the past time ... 

again i i'll try to be more consistent with the diary again , it could be good thing to keep up . hopefully it leads to desired results . 

today didn't work on my website , because i was sort of studying all day , i have 2 exams tomorrow .after that i wont have exams for while . 

hopefully i fix my sleep and go make a good schedule 

thats it for now .

i don't really remember what i wrote last time i didn't check it .

in the past 10 days i was dealing with extremely negative view on the world i don't know why . 

i though i was living in hell or something , was constantly thinking about . how worthless i am , that no one is actually my friend and im losing the ones i still think i have . 

that no one would really care about me at all , im just a sort of a tool for people to talk to , not really caring about my well being , while im kind of trying to be good to people in one way or another , i though that i was totally  worthless and i that i probably deserve it anyway .

if we imagined that the whole world is actually against me it would be less likely to me that im on the right there , i mean i cant say that ALL is wrong , right ? 
if people don't like me there is something wrong with me right ? , who else to plume ? parents ? siblings ? class mates ? school ? 

should i really just plume everywhere thing and say , no its not my fault . 
that seems like stupid to me , but im also trying to best to be a good person to others . i try to listen to them , i try to  make them feel welcomed , i try to make them feel trusted . 

why when i do all this , i end up feeling like exactly the opposite . 
what do i really want , why am i constantly thinking that people hate me , or don't like me , or don't want to talk to me . 

i don't know 

i still tried to write something in those days somewhere else and i have what i wrote im gonna leave it here 


— 03/16/2021
not sure whats happening
its not that i feel extremely sad,
but i just don't enjoy playing a game cuz if try to play my brain shuts down, if i try to work my brain shuts down, if im trying to learn new something and implement it my brain shuts down

— 03/22/2021
well i cant sleep... haven't done my diary in about a week now
its time to another one of those

so... ill be honest, big part of me hates who i am now, mostly thinks that i can never be anything more a failure.
i constantly afraid of being a bad impact on people around me, thats probably why i keep making jokes all the time, its way better to laugh.
but then me being me i think that talking shit about my self is... funny, at least i wont 'hurt'  anyone this way. and sense i don't really care about my self then i wouldn't matter.

the more i do this, the less respect i have towards my self, and the less people would respect me.

and i'll be able to notice that.
that results in me hating my self more.

i do think i can end the cycle tho
i think im already going down hill.
probably would never be able to fix this.

my only plan is to isolate my self.
probably focus on things that are more important, like find a job, actually finish your project, try to better my self.

but it seems like i no longer have the well power to do any of that.

usually i think... im just a waste of space, not really good at anything. doesn't have the well to be better. never been usefully, maybe only thing i can do is. 
be the clown ... nope also bad at it.
clearly notice that im more of annoying person. and its getting worse everyday.

ending it doesn't sound like a bad idea really.

its so weird its like i lose the ability to do things when i try to do the

— 03/23/2021
so im doing one of those again

plan was to sleep early couldn't.
so decided open vr chat, was in the world, where i used to spend time with my old friends.
kinda indicates thats im still holding to that past.

it made me a bit more sad than i was XD. started talking to my self... was mostly about the weird double standard where i kinda don't really 'want' friend but at the same time i do want to make friends. 
how that i need to let go of the past. 
the fact that i probably need help sense im starting to think about ending it, and thats is bad sign. 
the fact that i kinda hate my self. 

.till someone joined and decided to talk. and i decided to add them. 

we talked for a while, then joined a friend haven't see in long time.
spent the rest of the time talking about random stuff, joking...etc.
other newer friends joined and we talked for a bit.

and actually felt much better.

03/23/2021
i should just go back to writing my diary.
actually had a day without being negative about anything.
its actually nice, i need more of those XD
i being productive again.
i hope that would be the end of my depressed phase XD
all i need is... to just talk about it i guess

but i can only think how long it would take me before i think about ending it again


negativity is not all what happened tho 

so today and yesterday where actually fine days . i  didn't feel anxiety 
i wasn't depressed . i was even motivated and made 2 videos , that im still editing i finished one of them . 
and i got back to working on my website again . im going to actually finish it before i start the 2D Physics engine . 
i want to have an actually working website thing , and make one version where only i can post in it . sort of personal website . 

people can only leave comments and such . 

but thats on the making now hope it dose go  write . 

i'll be doing my best .

im still failing the not masturbating thingy . im trying but also eh . 
i was watching pornography when i was doing it so i think if i stop watching it the rate would go  down eventually leading to me stopping .

so thats the plan now . 

i mean its just a waste of time usually when i do it , i would be just trying to sleep . 
and just do what has to be done . XD 

but that was all i can remember for the past days i'll try to keep it for the best of my ability .

                    <p>
its been about 6 days now  , i haven't done anything production maybe only uploaded one video , project is still not online . 
its nowhere near done , im very late , so i just cant pic things up and work on it . 

been trying for hte past  3 days , but i cant work on anything , seems like im stuck , or maybe something is wrong with me , or maybe something that happened , or maybe something from the past , or anxiety about the future . 
SOMETHING , i don't know i don't seem to be able to help my self out of it . 

as per usually i don't know when is this going to stop .

i don't like working anymore , i totally fucked my sleep schedule , i don't go out for my walk , i don't even enjoy games now , i don't want to play games ,  actually more like i just cant play them , and i just cant work on my projects or anything . 

been kinda writing my thoughts out side this diary  but heres what i did write . 

{
— 03/09/2021
im gettin anxious again
havent wrote my diary today

starting to think that i might be an annoying or bad or just too negative, and probably my firends didnt contact me cuz of that, maybe they dont see me as a friend anymore.

i think im losing the"well", to do stuff. my skills are not improving and im just wasting my time, doing things im not enjoying

also starting to think that i might be effecting people "negatively" when i talk about my problems.
should probably keep  to my self

— 03/12/2021
so  . . . i guess im kind of afraid that my irl friends , dont really think of me as a friend anymore , or maybe dont care . usually i say they probably busy , they have something to do .
some of them havent seen in more than a year .
and none of them really starts the conversation most the time its me who try to keep communication going , but havent done that in long time that i feels its probably too late .

all of them expanded their social circle .   i didnt, well  i mean if you want to count people i know online then , i kinda did  , and now it feels like im losing my friends :D .

i need to learn how to be anti social again , probably for the best . 

welp that was somethin on my mind today for some reason decided to let other people deal with my shit so there you go XD

—  03/14/2021
havent done my diary in 3 days i guess probably even more , im just unmotivated to  , work on my stuff , im not sure why i'll try to sort ot " force my self " to get to working on my projects , usualy i everything go like normal  , if get through the first 5 minuts of working something , cuz then i do enjoy working on it . i'll try to do that when i wake up . 

not sure , if im actually fuked up already , or that im having hard time to let go of somethings from the past , its probably  a bit of both . 

seems like its going to be few shitty days for me , but i'll try go back to work as if everything normal . i'll act as everything is ok . cuz . . . yes , there is nothing better to do really XD

}

im bored all the time , nothing seem to really intertain , when i try to work , my brain shuts off , im not sure what is that wabout tbh , i dont really try to play games , cuz i somehow dont know what to do  with them anymore . 
i try to learn somthing but when i try ti implement it , again my brain totally shuts off . 
dont really enjoy food , kinda stoped seeking it .  unless i really have to . 
all i want to do all the time is sleep . 

wh is this happening , i cant find an answer , i need help . 
i cant afford it , probably dont deserve it . 
i dont want to end my life . 
but maybe i should .
things are slowly becoming . . . tasteless for me . 
nothing 
everything that i enjoy , games , programing , working on my project , watching videos , soon i'll probably stop enjoying talking to my friends . 
who knows whats there down the line for me .

                    <h4>Struggling to keep the progress going</h4>
                    <p>
so for the past three days i only did one video .
i dearly was able to hold to my  schedule  . im not motivated enough to work on my projects but at least i was able to make the video so , i guess its not entirely bad . 

but i've been feeling really bad , it was hard to get any work done , today i didn't do anything at all . 

im not sure whats the problem with me , i think its too late for me to help my self now , cuz its at the point where i believe i need help , and i probably a therapist , and there is no way for me to afford it  . 

im not sure what to do , where talking to my friends and cuz i forgot about  writing my . 

so that what i wrote in the past few days .

— 03/06/2021

Hmmm I'm noticing a problem
Where when everything seems to be going well
I just become aware of or remember a problem that I'm dealing with.
And that's when I start having anxiety and my productivity drops again
I start judging my progress, usually ends up in thinking that. It's not good enough.

— 03/07/2021
im gettin anxious again
havent wrote my diary today

starting to think that i might be an annoying or bad or just too negative, and probably my firends didnt contact me cuz of that, maybe they dont see me as a friend anymore.

i think im losing the"well", to do stuff. my skills are not improving and im just wasting my time, doing things im not enjoying

also starting to think that i might be effecting people "negatively" when i talk about my problems.
should probably keep  to my self


i wish could find a way to help my self , but it is funny that . 
today i technically helped a friend with something similar .
they said they where trying to learn an instruments again , they used to play it 10 years , and that they said that they are not being motivated while doing it . and its kinda similar to my problem. 

they are thinking all the time that they should be doing better , they need to be better , and they are so focused on not making nay mistakes , and sort of punish their self for making them , so i told them , well maybe your forgetting the point of it , its about having fun not being the best at it , its something i learned from listening to lectures form a "guru" by the name "allan watts" , they pointed something that i think me and my friend where ignoring . 

they said : "whats the point of playing music , or dancing , you dont try to finish the music as fast as possible  when your playing music  , and when your dancing your not aiming to end up in a specific point in a room or something , the whole point of playing music , is to play music ,  and whole point of dancing is dancing . " 

and i told them , why did you start doing it in the first place , and they said i did it because it was fun , i didn't care if i was good . 
so i told them that , this is how they should do it now , just play music and have fun . dont worry about being good , you'll eventually get there if you just keep doing it for fun , you wont notice it but eventually your skill will improve , but the whole point is to do it because you enjoy it . 

and that  was funny that it's coming from me , sense that was exactly the advice i need to follow . 
i was just keeping on thinking that i need to improve my skill , but i forgot that the whole reason of me doing my project is just to do them , because i wanted to do them . 
so i'll try not be harsh on my self and focus on actually just doing what enjoy doing , hopefully that goes well . maybe that is going to help me . 

i should thank my friend actually for that , probably been in a worst situation . if  i didn't talk to them . 

so that was it for the past three days , yeah and also i didn't survive the (no nut challenge ) XD . i'll keep reporting that until some point i guess . 

i dont even find it embarrassing to admit it . but its a problem that i need to solve . im still trying .

                    <h4>A boring day 2.0</h4>
                    <p>
nothing much happened today , i was kinda looking forward to talk to some of my friend , unfortunately i didn't get ot .

prepared for a video for to make tomorrow i think i should use obs only for video recording , and audacity for audio . 

also listened to some " therapy session "  a video about some person called Dr .k  ,  he usually interview people that are popular online . 
and he tries  talk to them about issues that they might be facing more of a "spiritual"  problems . 

and he was talking ot this person who said , that they ware dealing with a problem where they , enjoy working on something more than playing anything , or talking to friends . 
because they had friends before , and they lift them at some point , but their work feels like its going to be there for them when ever they need it , where as their friends might not be there . 

they also said that they enjoy work because it makes improve , it makes them think they done something , that they are good at something , and they broke it down to dealing with  a problem as child , where whey were punched for not being "good enough"  , being punched for trying to standup for them selfs at some point . 
they devolved a trust issues  , out of this , they  didn't really have much friends or even a social circle when they were to growing up . 
they got punished by their teacher at some point , which made the other children abuse them at some point . 
they moved somewhere else which stopped it .
but they felt the same when they were doing with work , from someone on who is their manager for example .

growing up they where told , that they are not good enough ,  they not smart enough , they should do better . 
ever though they are doing their best . 

they still only made only one friend at a time tho . 

all these except never having the social circle , im very familiar with . 

but for long time i only had one friend for half of my childhood , didn't have a social circle really until i was about 14 years old 

this caused them as well as me ot judge their self for not being better . 

and the answer for that situation . 
to judge they self for their my self this way ,

they also talk about blaming them self almost everything , also fulling the fire  for telling them self that they are not "good enough" , even if it is not .

they also have that problem of that they get emotional sometimes and it makes them feel weird  , and tell them selfs that they shouldn't cry for example , they shouldn't feel sad , they shouldn't , show  "bad" emotions .

and the answer for that is that , they had to accept them self having these moments , and accept that having these weird moments about showing emotions is totally ok . 

all of this make them really enjoy work becaus it feels like its a safe place , because it makes them feel good about them self , and it makes them feel like they are good . 
so they end up being "addicted" to work , spending too much time working and very little time spending it with friends or families . 

and even tho im still struggling to actually keep on learning stuff working out and doing "productive things " im slowly putting more and more time into work , im spending less and less time trying to talk to people really , unless it wont effect my production at all , i still play games . 

my unproductive time is more that my productive time , but its slowly starting to be the other way around . 

i do enjoy doing productive work more and more  , probably even more than playing games now . 

but they where told that they should try to make more than just one friend so that when things fall down with one friend you still would have the others .

maybe i should get more friends or . . . just stay away , on my own , and just dont worry about having or losing my friends . 

the fear of loss is big , im not sure if i can over come it , and the way i look at it is if i dont have anything to lose . i wouldn't feel as sad ... right . but this also means i have nothing . 

its a hard  thing to chose .

maybe someday i'll find and answer .

                    <h4>just a boring day</h4>
                    <p>
nothing at all happened today .

i ate too much 
i didn't workout sense i decided that fridays are going to be my "day off" of the week from work and learning 

i kinda planned to learn something today but i  didn't . 

im starting to get a bit anxious , since i saw one of my "old friends" appearing online again .  but still never communicated back . 

but i'll try to forget about the past 
maybe sometime soon i'll totally get over it . 

but thats it for today

                    <h4>Schedule optimization</h4>
                    <p>
today i edited  the video im going to upload it tomorrow . and now im thinking about changing a bit in my schedule so that one day for recording one day for editing and the third day for uploading ,so  that i only upload twice a week .

today i did workout again and went for a walk , but im thinking maybe i should make it so that i walk one day and workout the other , and i  can have friday  or saturday off .

the reason im doing this is because now university is taking a lot of my day , and its going to take even more time once i start getting assignments , i'll have to do them , maybe i can do them during my day off but that would probably beat the idea of a day off , but i wont have uni during friday and saturday so i can do them in one of those days maybe , and also because i cant find time to learn C so i need to move somethings  around in the schedule . 
im also trying to eat less while keeping on walking and working out . 
hopefully that works in me losing weight or maybe gaining some muscles  , cuz im like weak as fuk now and i dont like it at all . 

im having a problem where if i run or walk too much , my foot's skin would tear apart and its really painful , im not sure how to solve this problem tho , i'll see what i can do about it .

so when i was walking to day ,  i was a person who is taller than me , and i tried to walk faster than them , but i  just couldn't  , and i started thinking maybe im just in a massive dis advantage cuz im short , i was thinking it doest really look like i have any advantage , taller people would be stronger and faster than me , i probably wouldn't eve be smarter , which all is kinda of depressing for me cuz it makes me think i that i have soo little value as a human i guess , but it was starting to make me depressed about it and thought " why would that matter to me ? am i competing ? not really , why would i be competing in the first place for what , i should only compete with my self  , only try to be better that who i was yesterday not other people ,  try to improve on my self "  , but i also though thought that , the only advantage would be that , my body doesn't require as much food , and that  i would probably live longer  , that is if no other taller people kill me ofc XD . 

but also i accepted that , thats how i am , and i shouldn't be upset about it , its not something i can change , i can lose weight , i can gain muscles , i cant get taller , and thats fine .
being shorter doesn't make me a looser , it just means t hat i might be in a disadvantage physically in some situations , cant get em all . and it should always be that way . 

i still do think that i am living the life of a looser tho , i probably heard that enough for it to stick in my head now , but also it doesn't seem like im achieving anything , im still trying to work towards it , maybe someday i'll get there . 
but for now i am a looser .

oh and i also failed  the whole " dont yank it for a while "  thing , seems like those day gaps are starting to close , i'll try to put more days in that gap .

                    <h4>Still trying to improve</h4>
                    <p>
so yesterday i came back form my walk and i want feeling very well so , i ate food , and actually today at the time of writing this , i already ate food . 

im doing this  makes me not believe in my self at all but i guess i'll be able to somehow get to water fastings its much much better option for me to lose weigh , or i could workout . 
water fasting my lead me to lose , what ever muscle i still have , working out might be a better option sense i dont like to be a weak person , but i the goal is the same i want to lose enough weight that i wont be fat anymore . 
so i'll keep on trying . 

i also re- recorded the video and going to edit it today and upload it to youtube and lybrary , im also thinking in making a bitshoot account . 

im thinking on maybe working out today sometime before i go for my walk . (yes im still doing that)

so maybe i'll do that i'll try to keep working towards that goal of loosing a lot of weight in the next 2 months .

problem is im always seated when im working on my projects or learning something 
also i have to learn something today 
so i'll try to learn how to make some graphics appear on window in the next weak thats the goal for C programing . im still learning the basics so , a window is still a bit too much to do as the first thing . i wanna learn how to deal with data and data oriented programing . 

hopefully i do learn something 

so i'll see what i can learn today 


so i also realized something yesterday , i saw one of my irl  friends and i wasn't really able to talk to him , but i decided i can call him and ask how hes doing , it went like any usual conversation he said that hes doing fine , even tho hes not , i said that im doing fine even tho im not really , asked what he was doing , and i he said that he was waiting for a friend of his . and  we ended the call there , and i was doing my walk thing so i couldn't keep talking to him and got distracted till the end of the walk . 

when the idea got to my mind  , that one of the reasons i had anxiety is probably due to all of my friends expanding their "social area thingy" [im not sure what to call it] , and the more i think about the idea of having friends seems to not really matter that much anymore , i would think i probably can completely do without it , maybe at some point i'll just actually give it all up and live without any social interaction , or basically the minimal amount possible .

its just a thought im not  planing to leave everyone anytime soon , but at  least , its kind of a relief that now i know why i was anxious about friends , dose it make me a stupid person that it toke me years to realise that or maybe i wasn't really focusing or paying attention to it .

couldn't find time for me to learn C today im still trying to develop an efficient schedule .

thats it for today hope fully tomorrow is better i guess .

                    <h4>getting under the radar</h4>
                    <p>
ive been trying to set up my pc again to work fine with what im trying to do . 

i started preparing material for my video creation .

i'll make the first video today , i also enrolled in university . 

hopefully its a good decision but i wont know until waaay latter down the line . 

i failed the whole not yanking it thing again , im still gonna keep on trying not to . 
and i also started water fasting . 

and i have a plan for the next few months maybe , which is everyday i have to
1. upload a video or prepare for one .
2. learn something in C programing language 
3. have a one hour walk 

and hopefully in one month i'll probably lose some of my weight 
i'll be done with the project and i'll learn something in C and would have started doing something in my next project 

also i'll be writing here how many days left before i get to eat
3days left

alright so i already did record for a video and when i started editing it , i noticed that its low quality so im gonna have to re record that again tomorrow hopefully things go well , i did change the settings .

i cant get my self to learn something today 
my head really hurts i dont exactly know why , but  probably cuz i started water fasting , i still wont give up on it yet , hopefully i can keep going for a month , i  really want to eat something . 
but i have to keep on trying , i know that its just the first few days that are hard , but i'll stop if i have to .

im going to do my one hour walk a day thing , and if feel soo bad i'll go back and eat one meal , and probably keep it to bee one meal a day  with all the rest

                    <h4>getting out of track
                    </h4>
                    <p>
been failing for the past few days to do my work and keep a routine going 
its pretty hard for me i guess , im having problems to focus sometimes , i fixed my sleep schedule problem and failed a bunch of stuff , like not yankin it for a month XD , it shouldn't be hard for me , i just got bored again.

a month should pass , i'll keep trying my best im putting more days in between i believe .

however i wasn't working on anything too , im not sure why but im feeling too tired and cold all the time , im not sure if thats a big enough issue for me to go to the doctor for it , but if it keeps on going thats probably why , maybe its because i dont do exercising at all , i dont move that much anymore and i know i should , im planing to be in shape buy the end of this year , it dose sound like new year resolution Bullshit but i'll try to make it real. 

the plan is to water fast for 2 months . i'll see how that goes , i going to start at the start of the next month , a week from now i guess maybe less , im also kinda trying to eat less im not sure if i am .

im also working on fixing an issue with my foot , i have deformation with my big toe , makes it go towards the other toes in the foot , which results in a (slight to intense) pain while walking . 

and i think im slowly getting to the instance part . so i got something to "force it" back in place , but its going to take time maybe about a month or more to get it back to normal so i have to wear that as much as i can .

wearing it is impossible with other footwear so that meas i'll walk less , but if that gonna make it hurt less in the future then im ok with it , and that would be the perfect time to actually do water fasting so i guess its good after all 

its few hours from writing the 

so . im starting to go back to an emotional state again , im thinking about of how much of a failure i  am ,  im 23 , i dont have a job , i never really had a job for more than 2 months ,  i live in m y parents house , i doesn't look like im improving as a person , it always seems like im some sort of a stupid person who cant learn anything , or be useful , i actually do kinda think if giving up everyday i wake up , i think that maybe if i just five up and it would be more peaceful . i dont know

i dont feel like working on anything yet , hopefully today i'll totally fix my sleep schedule if no one wakes me up for no reason . 

im writing this at the beginning of my day . 

i really dont have any plans so , i dont wanna do anything too . 

feeling really empty . 

still cant figure out why im not motivated , to do my work stuff .

was trying to play a game and thing didn't work i have to reinstall it and being bored makes me wanna do anything , but dont want to work today im like incapable of thinking of how to do stuff now im just bored enough to start conceding yanking it , cuz its fo fukin boring now  i have to wait for the game to re install 

*few hours latter*  i didn't do that though , i been through some problems with playing that game , and i  got so frustrated i reinstalled the whole system again , and thing was fixed , i did try fix it in a different way but still didn't work so yeah , but everything is back  to normal .

im not sure what to do still i dont feel like playing the game at all anyway , im really unmotivated and there is nothing that i can do about it , maybe i need a punching bag . . . seriously i feel frustrated af , and probably taking some anger out is gonna solve it . im also tried af , and trying to stay awake as long as possible so that i fix my sleep schedule . 

probably yankin it would be a good way to let time pass cuz i take my time doing it for some reason , like no seriously i dont take long time to finish , still i take my time doing it 

well its like 6 pm now its still early to sleep so im not sure how im going to keep my self up. 
brain is like , just go have some yankin action that would technically keep me up long enough . 

im so tired tho 
and bored 
didn't get to play anything really cuz brain stopd working . 
hopefully i'll get working done tomorrow .

yeah as the title suggests i didn't really do anything today expect that i did a video for my channel stating for who ever might view my stuff , that im going to start over again , and i also decided to change hte way im going to record my videos 
im going to mdo the commentary while recording the video so that its less time consuming in the end . 

hopefully things go fine . 

i really want to start with my physics engine project  , and im not sure when but i want to do that asap , i still have the university thing to worry about still , and i want to get an actual chair , i've been setting working , playing , learning and communicating on a plastic chair and i dont like it , its not comfortable and my ass is fukin broken , but now i might have to wait even more . 

im getting close to fix my messed up sleep schedule , i feel really tired when im waking up during night time and i just cant get work done as effective as when i wake up at day time . 

i need to get back to work soon .
so much to do with so little time , things to learn , skills to master , programs to be written . 

its going to be fun . 

maybe i'll get my self in the habit of reading again .

i learn more about how i think and how to make sure that i dont end up leading my self to be sad for seemingly no reason

                    <p>
today i did a  lot of nothing . . . i actually didn't do anything today barely some "thinking" about my project . 

also today i did something im not very proud of doing which is masturbating , i was so fukin bored that i though it would  be a way to pass the time . 

so my plan is , just like things become a habit after doing it for some time , i can stop doing it for sometime and it wont be a habit and then probably wont do it again , from tomorrow cuz today doesn't count now dose it  ?

starting  from tomorrow i'll stop  and keep my self away for a month or even more if i can , and if i find my self about to  do it i'll try some form of punishment , idk exactly what its going to be but i'll try make something i hate so much . 

but other than that nothing happened at all

i've done nothing today on my projects today so nothing has been done today.

im still having dealing with my memories of the people i can no longer talk to , its like im rejecting them leaving . 

it doesn't make sense at all , but overtime i see the "place" where i met them and talk to them and spent a lot of time with them , even though those memories are happy ones , they tend to make me sad when i think about them , and sometimes i just cant help at all but missing them . 

i always feel like i have some un finished business with them . and thats why i feel the urg to try and find a way to talk to them . 

and i know i said i should stop living in the past and im really trying my best to stop remembering them and move on with my life  i still  think about them from time to another and it saddens me that i cant talk to them anymore . 

so now i spend some time in the "place" where i met them and it dose saddens me still . how ever i believe if i done this enough times it the effect would get less and  less effective on me .

but i also know that i still have to go through those emotions , and i cant really do much about it even tho i dont want to go through it anymore . it is still ok to be sad sometimes , i'll try to get through it and move on to the next thing i got to do , maybe more improvements. 

however im not sure what to do , now im trying to hold onto my current relationships and build them up to be something bigger than what they are now . thats how i should probably do it . 

maybe i still can make friends , but at a much slower pase . 

i'll still focus on making sure that what ever makes me happy is something that i do , something from within me , and not from someone else , but i'll also keep on trying to find a good friend .

                    <h4>A Bright day
                    </h4>
                    <p>
so today i uploaded my design  to git hup and had it containing all the content from my old design 

its working pretty well and its looks great at least to me ti does . 

im doing progress . i refined some of the design too , i added fonts , refined how images look . i even edited the website to look fine on mobile .

i might do some changes latter but all the changes gonna be done much much faster thanks to the variables i set for my style . 

now lets talk about something a bit more important , my decision which im still scared to take . 
and it seems like im going to be stuck for a while , i had this idea of maybe doing something different .

the problem is not the people , the problem is me holding to the past , i need to just get over it .
i'll try to toughen my self more , i need to improve both in my skills and in my mentality .

maybe i could try learning more things , new skill , start actually reading books and finish them . 

maybe i'll lessen the amount of communications that i do , maybe me trying to make friends is me trying to find happiness through a external source , which is  not a good way to live , it well ultimately leady to me depending on others more , pushing my self on them , and probably making their life harder , until they decide to leave me and that would lead to  me being sad and broken , probably not learning anything from that mistake gonna make me look for external source of happiness even harder . not realising i wont find it . 

so now what we do . im not sure where to go with that now . 

but im leaning towards not really cutting my relationship with my friends . but trying to only let it happen and not care about it too much , i'll try to be a good friend to them . up until they stop trying to be my friend , but i'll change the way i talk to them . 

again i need to talk less and and listen more , let the awkward silence land upon us . 

i'll try to also not get my self get "influenced" by other peoples  life style. but i'll try my best to learn from mistakes . 

maybe i'll start working on the new project in few days from now . 

but for now im feeling a bit tired and i need to fix my sleep schedule . 

i also have to . make another important decision , soon i'll have to decide weather to enroll in university or not .

im not sure where that would go . but also staying in place is not good so i'll have to try to enroll . 

its expensive and this is really annoying . again i still dont have a job , and the whole thing is my father's idea in a way , hopefully that getting that degree would probably make it possible to find a job someday , but i'll try to design things in the next few weeks and have the designs up . and maybe try to sell them . 

i need to find a way to make some money , maybe would be good way to prove usefulness , not for anyone , but for myself .

                    <h4>Stuck in thoughts
                    </h4>
                    <p>
yeah i didn't make a diary yesterday thats cuz my sleep schedule is still all over the place 

as the title  suggests im still not sure what i should do with the people i know currently 

i still can go "anti social" without totally cutting my communication with them . 

but that means i still would have communications to maintain .

but it also means if i need someone to talk to i'll probably have , and the people i know are not bad at all , i would say they are actually good people , i would love to keep talking to them too , i actually told them that i might entirely disappear . 
some of them told me that its a bad idea , and probably not a good plan , and that they would be sad / upset if i do , but it still would be my decision to take .
they told me that if its something i need to do they still respect that decision .

i actually feel like im making a too big sacrifice . 

im going to feel really bad for few months if i actually leave for good . 

am in a state of analysis parlays , where i cant decided weather my decisions are good or stupid . 
the risk can be higher that the reward in this case , i usually step away from this kind of sacrifice , but it dose seem like im having some real problems , maybe social anxiety , maybe just anxiety . 

i've been dealing with it for the past few years . well maybe sense i was 10 years old probably was dealing with something similar to anxiety until it developed it self to what i m dealing with now . 

my problem is im never sure of anything , which is good for learning things , makes me consider that i might be on the wrong side sometimes , being able to understand people better . 

the bad side is
im not sure of my relationship with the people i invested my time trying to know , im also never sure if i have a "good" skill or not .
or ever cable of doing or making something usefully , what ever "usefully" suppose to mean , seems to change meaning depending on the situation .

so people are being nice to me , and i believe that they are my friends , but the problem im never sure if anything including that . 
i've always thought people in the end would mean me harm at some point , maybe would try to use me for their own amusement . 
im not trying to blame the past , or the people before , but that was what my experience let me to believe . 
that no one would honestly be my friend . 

until my friends actually did convince me that there is some good people out there . 
and i sometimes believe that i did actually find them . 
and my problem is , that i keep on leaving . 
and now im thinking , maybe i shouldn't have , but at the same time . it doesn't feel like i can really communicate with all of them , some of them seem to have really good intentions . 

some of them seem to be just there . 
and thats fine , i havent seen any ill intentions from any of them . 

thats usually why i dont get attached to people . now im afraid of leaving . 
maybe its time to build a solid platform . a place i can  go back to . 
probably after that while i'll be able to go back to my "travels" between people . 

i cant keep on blaming past , its not ok to keep on leaving people , at some point i'll be running ouf of options . 

i spent few years learning how to talk ,  i should spend few more learning how not to talk . 
which is actually harder to me than it sounds .

but what would be a good decision , i dont think im capable of takin it now . 

im stuck . 

do i sacrifice all and crawl back into being ba my self . which going to give me a lot of time for development . 
but has the risk of me getting into depression again . 

i really believe that the people i have now are soo valuable that this decision may not be worth it .

or do i keep im maintaining my current relationship , and hold to my sanity , the risk would be them leaving , thats totally possible , i also tend to think that i might end up messing it up . and have all what i did ruined by me . 
would be funny that im scared of making a quick decision but thats where im at now . 

i have to decide .

i could always lurk for a while until i feel better about my current situation , its time to take care of how i feel about something i guess . cant believe i said that . 

but i'll also make sure there is room for improvement .

soon i'll update my personal website . 

i'll thinking of buying a domain name and having a server to host my page on . 

and things would work fine hopefully . 

now that i've gotten really good with designing i think its time to make few more templates and sell them for people . 

probably can make a profit out of few templates . finally .

and thats it for today . 

wish me luck . who ever you are reading this .

                    <h4>A tough decision                        
                    </h4>
                    <p>
so again today i did nothing , i m still thinking about the decision that im going to take that im really not sure about all , its hard to decide what direction i should go , the coast of both ways could be really really high .

so i decided yesterday to just go back to be anti social  ,  but the decision is , should i leave and have new start , or should i just keep what i have and what i have now and move on .  

what i mean is the friends that i made up to this moment . 

should i tell them all that i don't want to talk to them anymore , that would  be really rude and probably selfish . 
that means i'll sacrifice what ever friendship i made in the past few years .

that means i'll be able to go around without worrying about maintaining communications and i can start again and try to make new friends . 

the price would be all those friends that i  made so far , and even tho i was complaining , about things yesterday .
its not really the whole story , things have been happening between me and them , i still think they are great people , i still think maybe they consider me a friend , i still think they could be more than just people i knew on the internet . 

but still a part of me saying that , probably most these people dont really like me . probably im just there to fill the gap when it exists , a place holder , something not really useful but could be used sometimes when the good things are not available . 

witch is an idea that makes me want to cry everyday , feeling useless , or worthless , but . . . thats the life of a loser , its not really fun , its not exiting , but someone has to go through it . 

yes i'll try to improve , yes i'll try to make something out of my self , yes i'll try . 

but no way i can know for sure that things well get better .

just because i want something really bad , doesn't mean im going to have it , thats the reality of life . 

im  not saying my life is the worst , im just going through a hard time . . . mentally , im trying to over come , im trying to adapt , im trying to forget . 

but still thats like , you have to go though the bad time so you do feel really good when good times come . 

hopefully they do .

                    <h4>A point of change
                        
                    </h4>
                    <p>
today i've havent done any work at all thats not the main topic of todays diary but i'll get something out of the way 

im thinking the masturbation problem is getting worst somehow but i think have a solution for it soon hopefully well get red of it . 

so today i've been going i've been thinking about , turning into the anti social person that i used to be maybe a less extreme version of it .
and i already did give a heads up for my current friends that still talk to me that i might even give everything  up .

completely forcing my self to be on my own .

and im not sure where this well take me . i know for a fact that i'll be feeling bad for a while as soon as i start doing that . 

its important to note that cuz i'll have no one to talk or vent to . witch is something i try to do is find someone to listen to me when im having problems , but i'll try to only keep for myself . witch is a heavy load , and i been thinking that , its probably only me who well listen to what i have to say , there is really few people who would do that if i  needed to . 

i know that expecting people to be help / talk to me is probably asking too much for who am i as a person , i know this sounds like a cry for help in someway it is not .

so here is the thing , im not a very interesting person , im kind of boring and im  starting to think that im might be stupid , or maybe have low IQ cuz it seems like probably learning things is not the easy thing for me . or maybe im expecting too much from me .

so hopefully i'll be able to handle all the negative feelings that i've been dealing with , i  usually ignore anything has to do with feelings and try to work on my things and try to make somethings out of them ,but its been increasingly getting worst and worst recently . 

to the point where i cant ignore them , and i'll see where that take me . i'll try go back to work in the next few days , im not feeling well physically its like im getting sic again . hope fully not thing too bad .

i still really love the people i still talk to . but i think im getting my self somewhat too attached or maybe i think that people stop communicating i just end up thinking its entirely my fault witch is not good at all.

yeah so this might be a really important  point of change . i'll be tying to improve more , i'll try to complain less . 

i'll do my best .

                    <h4>Anxiety and regret                        
                    </h4>
                    <p>
so for today i did nothing . 

i was just trying music play that i can use in my system . i actually re installed the whole system too , felt like it was using a lot of my computer's resources so i though i might as well do it.

but with this topic aside , today i woke up and i was still dealing with negative thoughts about my self . 

thinking that im  worthless , and basing that on 

how it seems like people wont try to ... talk to me or spend anytime with me unless im the only option they have at the time , and that it doesn't look like they take me seriously , or think that im a stupid person . 

when it comes to communications im always the person who has  to keep the communication going , otherwise it wont continue , or at least that what it always seem to be the case for me .

and that i also have no source of income , i dont have a job , not much activities other than programing , designing , playing games and watching videos .

im starting think that i cant do anything anymore. that im welling to give up on my projects witch is all i have at this point .

i tried to reach for an "old friend" just to ask them how they doing and properly say goodbye to them one last time , but i think they dont want anything to do with me any more .
i feel like it was my mistake , even tho they where acting in a way that i wont be able to talk to them if i wanted , but they get to talk to me almost any time they wanted , in a way that made me feel like im just the last "thing" on list . and im starting to believe that . 

maybe it is something about me , maybe im just an annoying person , maybe i should go back to being an anti social break away from society . maybe thats for the better for me . 

i'll stop trying to communicate with others , i'll play the hard to get game . i'll stop reaching for others. 

i feel exhausted , maybe i managed to socialize with people very well , but still cant make what it seems like a friendship .

im might be naive to think about it this way , but when none of my "new friends" even ask how am i doing in more than few  months , for me it kinda gives me an idea about how much value do i hold in these peoples mind , probably. nothing . 

problem with most my communications is that they all are online . 
and i cant really try and make friends in real life cuz i dont see people at all , there is a pandemic and people need to stay home .

i dont have a job to go to , the only thing im going end up with is other collage students who are even more stupid than me , they are naive , they are not even interesting , and the only thing they have to talk about is sex , money , fame and looks.
now i know not all collage students are like that , but lets be honest most of them are . 

maybe im complaining too much , maybe im talking none sense , i dont know whats going on in my brain , i need to get whatever going on in my brain diagnosed but i cant afford it , im too broke for it . 

feeling useless , feeling worthless ,regretting my decisions , always blaming my self even for things that i probably shouldn't be blamed for , always feeling like im not enough.

thats why im not welling to invest in a "romanic" relationship at all , i know that if end up with someone that is even a little messed up in the head ,they well manipulate me , probably use me for whatever comes to their mind and they just get rid of me , and leave me to put the blame on my self .

i welling to risk a lot of things , but not my sanity . 

i dont know when this is going to end , or how its going to impact me , but i decided im going silent . 
i'll keep writing my diary of course , but when it comes to communications i'll just stop.

i always focused on solving the problem before taking care of how i feel about it , now all i want is for the feelings to go , i tired of feeling like a useless , worthless being , that no one is welling to spend time with , or even just asking about . 

im actually on verge of crying as im writing this , i've been like this for 2-3 days , i've been resisting that all the time , maybe i should give in , maybe i would get some relieve there .

i used to be anti-social , its time for me to go back to being that again.

the piece of mind is really important to me now .

                    <h4>Finished with anxiety
                    </h4>
                    <p>
good news i finished the whole website design . everything is done it looks good and .

i finlay can start working on the back end soon 

i have to make videos about it and upload them , then try to star with the back end i make it work well 

i stayed up from yesterday until 12 am this day and throughout the whole time i was feeling like i lost something , all the time thinking that i dont have any value at all . 

and what i did , is i started saying what on my mind in a discord server that is for my friend , they said i can say what ever i want there so i did say this :

" ngl . . . i think that I  really dont believe in my self and i probably should XD , its probably the biggest problem about me .

always thought that im a "loser" docent seem like i have value , everyday i think of just giving up on what im doing.
not sure how long i can hold on. 
but i can hope that i dont  just give up .

if anything goes wrong i tend to blame my self for it , i do that all the time.

docent seem like people take me seriously when i talk to them , always feels like whoever im talking to , they see me as a  stupid/naive kid ,
really hated that when i was younger , still do hate it , but i guess leading people to think that im not interesting  or stupid to lead them away from talking to me . 
problem is no one to talk to . when i need that .
end up being some weirdo who talks to him self most the time .
so now people also think that im crazy XD "

so ... that happened i was really missing the old friends that i cant get in contact with anymore 
was thinking maybe im not worth anything for them and thats probably why they left me , but its probably not the case . 
at least i hope it is .

so the plan is i want to re install my system again after i wake up , cuz i think i didn't maintain it well yet . 

but that was is for today 
i hope that the anxiety goes away soon . 

anyway i got things working the way i want it in my pc now , i want to upload videos of me developing my website , and i want to start working on my first big project (the 2d physics engine) , hopefully it goes well . its gonna take me years to learn all the things i need to learn but hopefully it well be fun , im looking forward to start learning again .

nothing really happened the reason i wrote this is cuz im trying to keep on writing them everyday . 

so ... i couldn't sleep until 6-7 am today , and i woke up at 2-3 pm , i got up toke a shower and ate , found out that it was 6-7pm  and decided that i was bored and i want ot play some video games and now im writing this at 11pm .

i have no idea how but i wasted a lot of time and i cant really do anything about it . 

i cant go to sleep now anyway so i'll try to work and finish the project's design today . and see what else is missing . and i'll try to finish that too , i'll probably start working like one hour after writing this diary .

so i almost finished the design today but . . . couldn't finish before the last thing i had to do . witch is dragging and dropping pictures   its all thats left 


i did the theme today 

and i think i got rid of few lines from my styles file

not much left , im actually getting more and more excited to work on the project again , hope fully things stay this way . 

maybe someday i'll be actually efficient in my work . 

not much to document other than that i'll be trying  to lower the amount of code as much as possible. 

i want it to be fast and functional im thinking if starting the physics engine soon in about a week so lets see how that goes

thats it for today it was good

so today i was checking on my CSS file didn't really do much i slept at 11pm and woke up at 5am , was still somewhat tired through the whole day , but was about to make a switch thing witch should have taken me 10 min to finish but then , the people who installed the whole AC thing in my room came , because we had some stuff that we couldn't finish , they actually my neighbors . so wasn't really annoying , but when they were done i was feeling tired and i couldn't really go back to work . 

i still have a good idea about what im going to do tomorrow anyways , and i also managed to stay up till 10pm witch means im going to have a stable sleep schedule and i'll be back on the progress . 

i was thinking if what more functionality i can add to my project so that it dose make sense for people to actually use it and im not sure exactly what im going to do .

but hopefully i'll get more ideas as im building it . 

im going to try to finish the whole thing tomorrow i should be able to do that .

then all i have to do the videos about the projects it self . 

hopefully that goes fine .

but we all know shit usually hits the fan .

                    </h4>
                    <p>
i basically did nothing today other than talking to my friends i couldn't not do work i couldn't really play anything i was too tried all the time . 

well i did manage to fail the whole try not to masturbate thing . . . talking about this is actually embarrassing as fuck . but i kinda dont care too . again it seems like its some kind of a routine thing that resets it self every 4-6 days . at least i see some form of routine here , that can be broken i believe if i wasn't bored enough . 

i wasn't feeling well too im still not feeling very well at the time of righting this .

my sleep schedule is allover the place . thats why there is one day missing , its because i stay up till 6am-11am.

i wake up at 8pm which means some days i cant stay up for 12 hours thats not good .

im writing this at 12pm tho i would normally be sleep but was surprised , that my father (yes i still live in my parents house) decided to install a AC in my room for some reason , i didn't know . 

not gonna lie im kinda against the idea , cuz im afraid this well end up coasting us more in the long term , it still is good to have specially in t he summer , cuz we get like 45C here for few weeks in some years . 

it also has to do with that it makes me feel dependant in a way , like i cant get that on my own , its an annoying thing that fucks with my mind every now and then .

so yeah the guy that suppose to install this thing is coming today i cant sleep in my room . 

i slept in the at 7am and woke up at  9 am actually and now i cant go back to sleep .

so maybe today i'll be able to fix my sleep schedule .

im not feeling well tho , for some reason my stomach is hurting i guess . i cant feel . . . whatever muscle tensing every now and then , not too painful but its annoying , actually feels like im sic , or about to be  . 

i actually tried to work on the project today i just couldn't get things done , my eyes and my whole body feels heavy , my movement is slow , and my brain is not working very well , i decide to write this now even i could stay p for a bit longer , just incase i forget to do that .

now its 8pm thats about 8 hours after i wrote everything above 
we are done with the insulation , unfortunately there was a problem we ran into and i cant use the AC yet , they gonna come back tomorrow to fix it , we couldn't do that today cuz it started raining heavily , i actually enjoy rain weather thing . was relaxing to listen to the water falling from the sky . 

im about to go to sleep probably in 30 minutes , i still felt tired through the day , but i guess it was normal i didn't really sleep more than 2 hours . and hopefully that well fix my sleep schedule now .

i really hope i have at least some energy to work tomorrow 

i also really want to mean the new people i met yesterday 

so lets hope for the best and see where every thing goes from here

                    <p>
so for today i didn't do any work , all i did is just playing minecraft .

and after i was done i decided to play Vchat , a game where you go online and talk to random people in virtual reality environment .
people can design avatars (takes a lot for work and still ) witch makes them chose what they look like . so you dont really see what  people actually look like , but that makes it so that you can see and talk to a person .

witch gives some sort of feeling that this place alive . your are talking to real people . they are actually real.
and thats the whole purpose if this "game" is to actually communicate with people in that environment , and its is fun , its serious , its annoying . its an elevated form of what social media was suppose to be like . 

i played that game a lot before . and i decided to go back to it again after i left it for few months , when decided to re design my project that im currently working on .

and it was actually nice i met new nice people , and im kinda exited to meet and talk to them again . im just worried that , it would stop me from progressing . 
but i'll try my best to actually do the work before anything else from now on . 

the sad part about me going back to , is i used to have friends in there that , some of them dont want to talk to me anymore , and some of them havent played the game in a long time , some of them i just havent seen in log time and seem like they probably stopped playing , and the way the game works is also players can make an publish "places" and you can "join" these places and thats were you would meet people . 

some of these places i still go to , are places i used to spend time with my friends in that "game" . and i'll be having a good time but also , the pace reminds me of talking to those old friends , it makes me sad that i can't talk to them ago . 

its like i lost something that is so valuable . 

one of them i decided to leave instead , i was trying to say goodbye to them , and i couldn't  so i just "unfriended" them then . thinking that would be good for both of us . 
so now i tried to look for them and sent them a friend request , just wanted to properly say goodbye this time .

i miss them and i really would like to talk to them or at least say goodbye to them  one last time .

i'll try to stop thinking about the past , i need to keep living the in present .

                    <h4>Doing the big think
                    </h4>
                    <p>
so today i actually didn't do any progress to my website , i dont know why tbh i got distracted with games actually .

but i also was thinking about a 2D physics engine project , i want to make  it so that its as optimized as possible so thats going to take a lot of time again im planing to work on it for the next 5 years .

i want things like cloth simulation , fluid dynamics "water simulation" , distractive objects , friction , attaching and detaching "objects" to each other , gravity . 
almost everything i can think of . 

so i ran into the problem of choosing the "best" programing language for the task 
and so far it seems like C is the best for this .

the reason that i say the "best" programing language and why i would have to learn new one has to do with the purpose of the programing language it self and also how fast it actually works .

some programing languages are made for applications , some are made for systems , some are made for websites .

and some of them are "easier" to get work done with than others . 
that depends on the level of the language. 
high level are used in applications and such , low levels are used for systems . 
but generally it means the languages it self deals with the hardware in a "specific way " 
lower level languages communicate with hardware better . 
and that means i would have much better understanding if what kind of resources im using . 

but that means i have to learn a different way of programing .
so i what im used to is a Objects Oriented Programing(OOP) , witch ties data with objects , this may result in different objects having the same kind of data but a different variables , that are going to be made in different times during the execution .

Data Oriented Programing 
deals with data that is already know what its going to be and separates it  from "functions " or operations that are going be applied on this data , and you wont need to make different "Objects" that have similar "properties" that are going to be handled in different stages .
the data can be used sort of "globally" so you wouldn't need to make variables inside the objects .
resulting in dealing with less un-necessary work . maybe its going to also be easier to clean the memory from the "no longer needed" data in the memory . 

and after so far after the small research i've done it seems like C is going to be the best language i can use for the task for now . 

and in the next few weeks im going to try and have that happening and i'll try to make a small play area . and have a "box" fall and i'll see where it goes from there . 

so yeah i got distracted with those 2 things . 

tomorrow my plan is to make the log-in/sign-up page for the user and maybe make the  "edit | delete | follow" option for the posts , and making dragging and dropping pictures a thing 

hopefully i'll get that done tomorrow i'll try to work more actually . 

but other than that nothing happened .

                    <h4>Almost done</h4>
                    <p>
so today i made some progress , actually almost totally done with the design , i have to do next is just the options for the user to edit or delete , their posts witch should be ease to do its just a menu that appears when you click on it , and the ability to drag and drop one or multiple pictures .
and the expanding of the form section when users enter too much content so they have more view , and its going to be useful when users add the pictures , they can see them , and they can delete any one they dont want to "upload" . 

this sounds like a lot of work , but im sure i can get it done in 1 or 2 days . its mostly things that i have already done before .
there is no "re design" process to go through , there might be some complicated stuff  but for the most part its going to be an east thing to get done.

i didn't really do a lot of work today but still some progress is better than none .
the more i practice the more i want to work for longer hours .

however im still  failing on the whole 'trying not to masturbate' issue every 4-5 days.

im trying to not make it happen but really sometimes i only do it cuz im bored or cuz i cant really sleep. 

anxiety levels are still lower than usual , i cant say that this diary is the cause of that but it seems like it . im not complaining tho , less anxiety is good for me right now . 

i need to find a new community tho . i actually left the one i was in few weeks ago . 
somethings happened there , a person who was a friend of mine got some drama going on , he didnt like that some of us didnt have the same view as he did . and decided to leave , but he also toke a chunk of other friends with him , witch made it look like turning people on each other . 

it wasn't entirely his fault tho . 

but it is what it is , after that i decided to leave a bit earlier than i planned . 

and now i need some communities . 

i still contact with some people that i got to know through that community . 

some of them i knew before and that community made me realise there is some really good people out there.

im not gonna mention names but for those people if by any chance your reading this ...

i love you guys , i dont know where i would be now if i didnt get to talk to people like you .

                    <h4>NO progress</h4>
                    <p>
so as the title suggests i didnt do any progress today i was thinking about it all the time but didnt feel like doing . 

and this is a problem i should just not do work because i didnt feel like.
i dont even think taking decisions based on feelings is a good thing . 

i'll try to avoid that a lot i only spent this day playing minecraft , cuz i felt like i want to play a game , entertainment is important but work is important too . 

i should try to balance this , someday its all work and no entertainment , some are all entertainment and no work . that doesn't really look like a good plan . 

i'll see what i can do about it , but that was it for today nothing much happened today in general it was one of those boring days where everything feels slow and nothing really is happening . 

at least i did peace together what i wnt the last few designs to be like so i'll work on that tomorrow and make it a thing , also been thinking about depression for some reason , i wasn't depressed but i was thinking about it . 

i am worried about future though , cuz i dont know what might happen . and now we're in a pandemic , i cant find a job , im relaying on my father who wants me to attend university which is expensive.

that decision has to be takin in less than a month from now , and i dont think i have much choice , its the only investment i have , this pandemic is going to keep things the way it is for at least another 2-3 years , which is roughly the time its going to take me to finish my university so might as well take the chance sense im not finding any jobs .

nothing serious happened so all is fine .

                    <h4>keeping the progress going</h4>
                    <p>
today i was able to design the skill form and the skill row so that the user can add those if they want to , the user should also be able to add an icon to represent the skill if they chose to . 

how ever its suppose to be a drag and drop mechanic and i know how to do it im just going to leave that until the end , after im done with designing everything . 
and im almost done , im getting closer and closer everyday . 

after the design is done i have to film all the things that i do . upload it to youtube and lybry/odessy and proceed to the back end . witch i already done most of it . how ever i might rework the whole thing latter .

maybe im gonna have to edit the data structure but for the most part it almost already done. 

then all i need really is make a reliable database and project would be done .

the only problem i notice is that i feel tired throughout the day and  that i feel hungry a lot even though it wont be long sense i had something to eat before.

not sure what is causing that but hopefully i'll be able to find out 
also i need to fix my sleeping schedule. i stay up for really late hours im not sure why 
that was it for today . 

and it seems like the program i was using first had something wrong with so now im using a different one

                    <h4>small progress</h4>
                    <p>
so im back to actually working on my project again , however i wasn't as fast as i used to be 2 weeks ago , probably because i stopped  "practicing" for 2 weeks . how ever some progress is better than no progress . i still didnt finish the design totally .
i'll probably need about 2-3 , more days . but im actually back to work which is good .
sometimes it takes me much longer before i go back to progress , i dont know why but .
this used to happen every time i stop doing progress for few days , then try to get back to working but i struggle for almost a month to go back to actually work on the thing i was previously  was working on at that time .
i get sort of "stuck" i guess , where im at my work place , and i am i about to start working but then nothing. as if im incapable of thinking or even doing simple  movement. even tho i know how to do the thing i need to get done .

im still not sure what caused with issue , but i always thought it was self doubt .

                    </p>

                    <h6>Story time</h6>
                    <p>
see im not exactly totally a normal person kind of thing even tho i hate to say that cuz it implies that i think im special , im not im just a random person actually really normal .
thing is i just havent had much friends growing up , i had few really good ones , but we were not with each other all the time . 
and even then at some point i didnt feel like i had friends .
also i wasn't socializing very much , so i was the awkward kind in the class growing up too , and i was bullied a lot , even tho i fought the bullies all the time at some point i just gave up .

i was always being compared by my parents to other kids . me being the useless kid who cant do anything right , while the other is much much better than me , and it looks like i would never be as good , i'll never achieve anything , that im not good enough . 

not to make my parents or other kids around as the evil figure of the story . its just wat it is , and i dont really pack any hate to any of them .

so thing is i end up eventually thinking , maybe their right ... and i see that as good thing , cuz that leads to me to actually pay more attention to what i do and what it leads to , and hopefully eventually "fix" my self and maybe improve and hopefully in the end , i might be somewhat  useful , maybe good-enough . 

but now im 23 at the time of writing this diary . i dont have a job , i can barely have a project running . i dont even know if what im doing would end up useful , and i do take a long time to get it done almost perfectly . 

and in the middle of all this . im still watching my self and my progress , and when i decide to stop for few days .
and go back to work , all these ideas of being not good-enough , im totally useless , and this thought is sort of "loud" in my brain when i stop working on something , and even louder when i go back .

it would sound something like : " see , you still havent finished this even though you worked on it for too long , it dose seem that you are actually useless , nothing your doing is really working very well , and even when it dose , it doesn't seem like its useful for anything , you have been trying to improve for all this time , but . . . i dont think you did actually improve , you are of no use , not even for your self . so maybe you should give up ".

and thats for me when i get stuck . for few days . . . few weeks . . . even moths . usually in the period of time , i am really depressed even if i dont look or sound like it , it doesn't seem like anyone notice if i am , and i dont blame others for that it seems like i got so  used to it that i still look normal when it happens . 

i noticed that when i left some communities and , some people reached for me and asked what happened , and when i gave and answer , they had no idea that this is whats happening , and yes the way they  talk to me changed a bit at that time , but thats because it is a very seriously bad place to be in , some people would kill them selfs at this point and i really dont blame them . it is horrible . 

and probably the only reason i didnt kill my self is cuz i had some people who decided to reach out for me , i dont know why , but they did and i do appreciate it . 

                    </p>
                    <h6>story end</h6>
                    
                    <p>
so if anyone is reading this and you are dealing with any kind of similar problems , please reach out for people and ask for help , i know it doesn't feel right to ask others , you might think that you dont want to bother others with your problem , you might think that its weakness to see for help , might think that this situation is something to be ashamed of ,  you might think any sort of thought that suggests thats asking for help is a bad thing to do , but its not , dont get your self stuck in here , there is a way out . anyone can find it , but at this point help is needed , please reach out for it .


this dairy is going to be in my personal website . and in a social media website that im making right now , so even tho there is some embarrassing shit in here . there is also some serious problems that im still dealing with and trying to overcome , and maybe someone else is dealing with this problem , and  this might help them.

but fortunately this time , it didnt happen im not sure why but again it could be anxiety , sense i started writing this diary im having less anxiety to deal with . so maybe thats why.

but anyway thats it for today , it wasn't bad , it wasn't best progress i've done but its is some and progress is back and hopefully is going to improve a bit more .

                    <h4>Back to progress</h4>
                    <p>
so , i know i've said i would do the dairy everyday , but i ... lets say got busy . so yeah i'm sorry , to my self i guess .

but what i've been trying to do for a week , was trying to mount my computer on a wall instead of having it inside a case .
the reason for that is i was kind of annoyed of it eventually . so i have a piece of wood that would fit my whole pc .

and started working . with the help of my father . thankfully we have some power tools to play around with .
but the goal was also to do it only with what we have in the house . and i started looking a room wim happy i did the  mounted pc thingy have outside of the actually house contains a lot of stuff some of it is older than me .

and i was looking around and got what i need , started working . 3 days of work and it was done . 

and here it is 

<img src="img/IMG_20210109_23261asdf.jpg" alt="">
<img src="img/IMG_20210126_013827.jpg" alt="">
so there was also 2 days wasted thinking what stuff to use for mounting the pc .

so now ht can only hear one fan only while its working at full force . the reason is because my computer is in the same room and when it was in the case it was too annoying to try to sleep while its running , and i'm trying to have my computer on almost all the time , i wont actually do that ALL THE TIME. but sometimes i'll need to have it on for few days or few weeks .

and unfortunately i didnt work on my project at all during that time i was being lazy sometimes , the other times i was working on the .

so the plan now is tomorrow i well finish the website's design . cuz there isn't much to do .
i'll try and re do that on an older version , record it , edit it then record an explanation to what im doing . then upload that to youtube and LBRY/odysee. 

and after that i need to start working on the back end . and hopefully buy the end of the next month i'll have the project working as i want it to work . 

and that was it for the past week , no more too busy days to do the dairy . im happy i did the  mounted pc thing , now i'll be free to do what i want . hopefully gain experience .
and start working on the other projects soon . 

im currently using a text editor that i dont really like but its the best i could find that works its called "lifeograph" its not bad .

i just didnt like the way it worked .

so im going to make one that is better for me at least .
have good day.

                    <h4>A boredom , and breakdown of progress</h4>
                    <p>
im back after few a week fo not having a computer to work on 

I "accidentally" almost totally rect my bios and i didnt have the tools to fix it my self so i had to drop it at a repair shop
it took a week but i think it should have taken less than that , and i think they fixed it but they didnt call me 
it was one of the slowest weeks i ever lived .

during that period i tried to do things that my pc would get in the way of me doing it . i took old pc pats that we have , and i got the fans inside of them in order to use them somewhere else . the plan was to use them in my case but , i decided im going to mount my pc parts on a piece of wood and and that that piece of wood mounted to the wall 

i also "made" a new disk for myself , i felt like i needed more space and i think i talked about this in the last diary , and sense my computer was not there i decided i can mount the wood piece we have in the house  and make a much larger space to play with than before about 3-4 times the size . 

the problem 
well boredom makes me . . . do things that i actually dont really want to do , but sense i had nothing else to do i'll do what ever comes out in my stupid brain to waste time faster .
so what i did is that i got back to wasting my time with masturbation , not all the time cuz that would be ridiculous .
but i see that this problem is much bigger than i expected it would be . im going to do my best in fighting it .
the more i do it the more im going to talk about it , its embarrassing af , and im going to have this available to who ever decides to  read this . 
i dont want to be  seen as a guy who dose nothing but masturbate when hes bored . 
i do work 
i have few projects , im still working on 
i was able to make a desk instead of just paying someone to do it for me , i m mounting my pc on a piece of wood . 
im trying to learn things , im trying to improve as a person , be useful , independent .
i still end up being really anxious about my self , especially when im about to sleep . however , i noticed before my pc get reckt sense i started doing this diary , im felling less and less anxious . 
im gonna try keep this going . 
i should have writer this like 2 days ago but there is a reason why that didnt happen 

breakdown of progress 
so when i got my pc fixed , for some reason the computer didnt want to boot into my system . i didnt know why .
and i decided not to fix it , and just reset everything again , i can reconfigure that my self i've done it enough times now i know how it goes.
and it was fine until the tonight it seemed like i almost killed my bios today so i decided i'll reset it before anything bad happens .

so i'll be back in few days to progress , tomorrow im gonna have to go visit some family but i might not go .
im doing this diary at 3 am but im doing it for the day before . 

and today i'll try do another diary regardless of something interesting happen or not , or i do some progress or not 
im going to do this everyday now . 
maybe its going to help with my anxiety . 
i'll see how it is . 

heres pictures of my old and new disk 

this is the old one 
<img src="img/IMG_20210115_004335.jpg" alt="">
this is the new one 
<img src="img/IMG_20210116_142616.jpg" alt="">
i can flip it too , idk why but i decided why not have that 
<img src="img/IMG_20210116_140703.jpg" alt="">
and thats the end result 

so the reason i want to mount the pc well more room to use on the new desk also its loud sometime , and having it mounted on the wall means i dont have to worry about having fans in the case , cuz there is no case anymore .

                    <h4>Reasonable choice ?</h4>
                    <p>
so today i have not worked on my project at all so not much to report about it but , tomorrow i'll force my self to work as much as possible i'll aim for about 6-8 hours of production witch should finish the the rest of the design for my project if i dont decide to change anything about it .

so recently i was dealing with "over heating" problems with my pc , my  cpu would get to 40-50 on idle witch is not normal  and not good .
usually the best move is to get  a new thermal paste and apply it for my cpu or getting a new heat sink but i decided i dont want to spend money at all .

so i decided to try and increase the cooling efficiency , by removing the front panel of my case , that worked well and it dropped to 30-40 on idle witch is great but its better than what i started with , so i realized if i keep the front panel opened a lot of dust would get in , so i removed the front panel material so now its just a frame and im going to have a dust filter to stop the dust from going in and i , have maximum air flow.

i also did managed the cables so the thing doesn't look messy.

<img src="img/IMG_20210109_2326172.jpg" alt="">


now i realise that i need more air flow but i decided not to buy fans, and what i did is i toke old computers cpu fans cleaned them and im planing to mount them to my case but it was dark outside at that point and most material i need are in the back yard for my house and i decided i'll do it tomorrow .

unfortunately its not totally free cuz even though i have the fans i cant have all of them before i get a cable that allow me to connect multiple fans but that is hopefully going to be easy to find .

and that was  it for today . 

im not working on the project and thats cuz im thinking about the new desk that i need to make and taking measurements , i was about to buy a  whole set of fans but decided against it , i dont want ot spend money in them i want to save the money for a better pc and more storage cuz i dont have a lot of it . 

i'll be going back to the project full force as soon as im done making my new desk though .

but im glad i found out that . i can make use of old things and i can find actually solution for problems without having to replace something completely or pay to fix something . 

and that did make me feel good about my self . i guess i wont have anxiety tonight and im glad to think that .

                    <h4>exciting news and anxiety</h4>
                    <p>
so today i did the measurements for what going to be my new desk , and it dose seem like i'll have a lot more space to work with once we're done making it , it could take us few days maybe 2 weeks max , but im excited.

now today i actually didn't do much in my project i only did the background picture and the profile picture for the about page that's going to be made for every user . it toke me longer than i though it would but its functional in chrome based and firefox based browser.

wasn't a very eventful day .
i spent the day on a voice chat with people i knew for a while , and it was interesting for the most part , the people i was talking to were getting drunk , and i kind of started to notice people appear more for who they actually are then they drunk , and i learned a lot that , some people are really arrogant , some of them are good people , witch is to be expected .

and it was interesting when some of them said that , they think im a good person , and that they respect me .
im kind of not used to hear good things about my self from other people , it dose feel like im . . . welcomed , but i would usually say that im probably not a good person , and probably there is things that are wrong with me it i need to fix it .

i tend to think that im not a good person , not very useful or not good enough to do "things" and this thought keep going for few hours usually the time  before i sleep . im not sure why this happens. 

but i cant help but think this way , some people "say" im a bad of a person some of them said that im actually a good person .

maybe its some to do with me . 

but thats something for me to figure out in the future.

                    <h4>Pause , and an interesting encounter</h4>
                    <p>
so this well be a bit different that the past diaries . 

first of of all 
i didnt not do any progress , on my project i started the day buy waking up trying to clean my computer, found out  that my thermal paste got my cpu and heat sink stuck to each other  and ripped the cpu off - its amd cpu - , and i  dont know if that effected my cpu  from inside or the socket i hope its good but we going to find out , for got that you have to change the thermal paste when you remove the fan and i cant even buy thermal paste . 

i can make it survive for a while before anything bad happen. 

but that's about it for the technical stuff.

we got visitors (family) today and , it  was  an interesting visit to say the least . i was talking to my uncle who is a Carpenter about a piece of wood suitable to be used as a "disk" and have it mounted on the wall so that i dont even move it around in the room , was surprised that i dont need that much material and it wont coast me much .

so that mean i'll have more space in my disk witch im going to need eventually. so thats a t least a good thing .

now to the different part .
note : you might have a different take on the topic , this is just my opinion. and im a bit biassed when it come to this topic .
this  might disturb someone who's reading but i dont care cuz here where i get to express what i really think about something anyway , so your hear purely to know what i think about what. getting mad at me for it is a waste of your time .

so im from a country called jordan , this country is next to a "state" that i believe should've never existed known as israel , today i "met" someone from there in a voice chat section on discord(voice + text communication program) and was the first time i see them and so were Curious to where hes from and they replied israel , and i dont exactly remember how it went political but i believe it was about his accent first , then about where he lives and them he was talking about working with arab people in the "state" he lives in , and mentions something about his "state's" practices  and that he dose not agree with it . 

and that he wishes that the issue in this area can be resolved .
and here where me and another person in that voice chat , had some things to say . 
we basically said we dont think that israel should exist as it is now and it should be dismantled  and people should leave somewhere else . 

now he replied with "i dont agree with that" , and we started arguing about this topic . 
and we had some back and forth on the topic , my last conclusion about this issue is that . it cant be resolved . 

and the best way to do that is :
1- to disarm both parties . (witch is impossible)
2- remove old people that were in power from both parties out of the whole system  .(witch is impossible)
3- have the people who been kicked out of their land back that means they have to be moved from a lot of places they are in now back to palestine . (witch is impossible)
4- resolve the (people who live in the taken land) issue . (witch is impossible)
5- also probably suing all the old leaders for war crimes . cuz we have good enough evidence to back that up. (witch is impossible)

and his argument was we need to solve this problem peacefully 

but . . . regardless of how (jews been abused) in history , that doesn't justify , a army invading land destroying the houses op citizen - still happening to this day - and also killing the citizen including children , women , old me who cant fight back , destroying farmer lands , forcing the people out of the whole country , and also coming up with a "solution" for the people who been kicked out of their land with something  they called "alternative country" as they  did refer to jordan witch has a big amount of its population that is palestinian , so that "now they just stay here its fine ". 

on top of all that jews are not the only people who suffered throughout history , so that argument wouldn't make sense , and there is this weird argument of . we where here first thousands years ago , witch absolutely dose not make any kind of sense  , jews were no the first people there , there where people before them and also those people were not the first people there and not the ones before them . 

it doesn't make sense to me that , this would be even considered a valid argument against war crimes and almost committing homicide.

to his fair he said that he wouldn't argue about this being a good reason . 

but i did tell him something 

that in order to solve the problem all the steps above have to be done . 

also you need to find a way to Compensate the damage done to the country and people who were in it .

but that also means that your most likely with all the people in the "state" you live in have to leave. 

to witch he didnt agree with -understandably- he has his own view points and i have mine.

but i had to say at the end 
"you cant say i want to solve the problems peacefully but i also would like to keep the land that has been taken away from the people who been forced out , things dont click together this way "

                    <h4>progress and problems</h4>
                    <p>
today i was able to do some progress after 2 days of wasted time on things that are not so important, as i expected i didnt progress that much , that usually happens when i stop for few days and then try to start again . 

but some progress is better than no progress at all . 


i also been trying to lose weight , im not sure if i am losing weight or not , i go out for a 1 hour walk/sprint , i do spend as much energy as i can during the walk , i used to be somewhat at some point so i still know how to workout properly , also im trying to eat less food and drink more water . that usually helps im trying to eat half the amount of food i usually do now and also trying to workout everyday .


however today seems to have had an impact on my feet , im not sure what the problem is but , the joint at the start of my feet hurts a lot after i walk or run , also i have another problem with the other feet where i have my big toe a bit deformed and it makes walking a bit default for the first 10-20 min , but the pain goes after that . 


my feet still hurts at after the activity , i know thats not always a bad sign but this one doesn't seem right , i'll try and see a doctor when i can afford it .


unfortunately is not all positive news , as i still notice my problem with masturbation , but at least i have a hint , boredom . this could have been avoided actually if i just did something else , i was done with my work for the day and when i had nothing i just though i wanna do something and for some reason thought that i had nothing else , it also annoys me that i also go out of my way and look for pornographic content witch makes me keep going with the masturbation problem as if its normal , so i need to think of a way to make that much much harder to get to . im not sure how but i'll try something . also i know now that all i need to do is to busy my self with other things . so maybe more activity or just play video games would help.


i'll be more focused on that problem from now on , i'll also try and work more on my project . 


for today i've designed the blog page and posts and also fixed some repeated code issues i'll do that again and i'll record and upload that so maybe people well learn from it .

                    <h4>Distractions</h4>
                    <p>
so for the past day I've been bussing my self with customizing the way most my programs look.
and it did take me a while , i actually re installed my whole OS , and it may sound like (not bad) idea but  the problem is it dose seem to be distracting me from doing what i should be doing . 

all that time could been used to learn new skills , progressing in my projects , yet i chose something else that dose take effort , it dose make me learn something .
but the things i get from doing it is almost in valuable compared to the main goal .

so easy to get my self busy by doing something that take effort yet have so little value instead of working on something thats far more important , has way higher value in the end , it could be what ever - lizard brain - me trying to do to steer me away from working on things , by making me doing something that takes effort, to use it as an excuse to say " I'll do that tomorrow" .

but at least i do realize this distraction , its interesting that it dose happen , and i'll try my best to fight it . hopefully i'll be working back on my projects the next day 
sense this day is already done . 

learning that i could be the thing stopping myself from progressing is valuable by it self so maybe it wasn't a total waste.

nothing about my projects to report today unfortunately .

                    <h4>Improving</h4>
                        </h2>
                    <p>
so for the past few days i was working on my website project i've done some improvements and made things look a bit better

im trying to learn (C) programming language now and im it seems pretty doable for me i probably can do that in few days, maybe i'll have simple game running and i'll get some understanding on how data structure works in that language .

but thats it for my programming part , some improvements been happening i do enjoy what i do and it boosts my mood when i see my self doing progress.

                    </p>
                    <h4>Problems</h4>
                    <p>im trying to fit some reading in my schedule and sometimes it seems hard , i'm not totally sure why but i might just lack the motivation.
recently i cant really sleep on time , or wake up on time , and i have a masturbation problem . . . thats probably embarrassing for people to point or even write down just in case someone sees it. 

for me i'd rather write that down my self to at least point out the problem as it might help me go through it . i dont like it when i masturbate or don't enjoy it in the end , i have no idea why i keep doing it , but i realize that it is effecting my life in a bad way and a solution is needed , and i'll do my best to control what ever (desire / addiction) that might be , i'll try to stop and never come back , and i'll make sure that i write that down here .

this takes me to a next issue witch is a problem a lot of people facing now days , overweight , i am at the level of obesity and thats not good i was fine with being fat for long time , i didnt care but recently it feels like its annoying me , i dont like not fitting in my old clothes , the feeling of being heavy with every movement i do , even setting down feels like i have so much fat in the way . 
so im starting to actually get the habit of eating less and exercising. right now i weigh about 85 kg and im 160cm tall that's like 5.2 
and thats soo much body mass for my height , yes im short , i dont really mind that . although i do notice some disadvantage .

another problem im trying to get rid of is feeling so tired when waking up , it dose take me a while before i get out of my bed. 
im not exactly sure what might cause that even tho i do get enough hours of sleep , it still end up feeling really tired when i wake up , im thinking it could be a side effect of what i eat , my weigh , what time i sleep maybe something with my bed it self .

so im in the process of trying to improve my self , maybe make my life a bit easier .</p>

                    <h4>Starting my journal</h2>
                    <h6>My journal experience</h4>
                    <p>
                        so this is going to be the first page i write about this 

                        this is going to be an interesting experiment ,i'll be attempting to document my days 
                        almost every day 
                        I'll be writing my progress and my mental states  goals what i want to achieve and difficult that i am facing
                    </p>
                    <h6>Introducing my self</h6>
                    <p>my name is sufian , im also known as "Darkx97" on the online world .

                        im a 23 years old on the time of writing this document 
                        
                        im a beginner programmer , im interested in computers , philosophy , and psychology .
                        
                        at the time of writing this im working on a project , a website , where no censorship is taking place everyone is allowed .
                        
                        the main idea is to talk about topic no matter how silly or serious the topic is.
                        
                        i believe that having the ability to discuss any kind of topic between people with different opinions well lead us to have a better understanding of that topic , witch might lead us to solve problems we are facing .
                        
                        preventing the ability to discus topics for sensitivity reasons , would lead to a disaster; due to the lack of discussing topics , it may be miss understood and this would lead us into making a problem out of the situation or , making the problem worst by choosing the wrong way to solve it . 
                        
                        everyone deserves to say what they think , even if it was totally wrong . discussion it self makes solving
                        problems way more efficient
                    </p>

                    <h6>future projects</h6>
                    <p>
                        i have few things in mid to work on in the future

                        1- 	i want to learn the "C" programming language , and i want to make a physics engine 
                            one that works on "small scale", with the ability to make video games that might use physics inside of it 

                        2-	creating tools to control my computer using voice commands
                            i'm a lazy person sometimes and if i can work now so that i can be more lazy latter i'll gladly put the effort

                        3-	a combination of calendar , alarm , diary , notes and todo list programs 
                            right now im using ones that are already made by other people but the way they work dose not suite
                            my needs exactly so i'll be trying to make some of these or maybe all of them

                        4-	a  rogue light   video game 
                            i like video games they are fun , they can be more fun with friends . 
                            and im thinking i might try and make one that i can play . alone or with friends .
                    </p>
